Hello! To keep a effective home and work at home balance it is best to have a separate work space for you where you can concentrate and do your work efficiently. Some of the things that I like to do is spend breaks and lunches with my family and dogs. This gives me extra time with them that I don't usually have and it allows me to break my work day up. If that isn't an option, I will do household chores on breaks and lunches so that I have more time after work for family. Sometimes, I will even run local errands on lunch for groceries and other things too. Really I like working at home because I do have a lot more time to spend with my family and pets. Basically to me, it is a game of time management. I do whatever I can so that I have even more time than before with family. Plus I am working on my health by walking on breaks with family if they are available or awake at that time. I wish you the best of luck and if you have any questions or concerns please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks

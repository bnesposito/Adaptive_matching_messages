I am a bit older than you but I totally understand your situation since I have worked from home for more than 25 years throughout my career. I also raised two sons mostly by myself while doing it. The first thing to do is to make sure you have a private quiet place to work. The family needs to know that when you are in that space that they need to be quiet and not to disturb you since you are working. The next thing is to organize your household so that you know when you will be doing your household activities, like cleaning and relaxing. Since you are at home, it is important to have instructions on your door that explains that you are working and can't be disturbed. It is also important to turn off your phone and tv if it interrupts your work. You should also start at the same time every day. Take breaks throughout the day at the same time and quit for the day at the same time. This is important so that you can relax and get that needed downtime from working. Even if you love your job, you really need that time for yourself. Make sure that you have snacks and a lunch already made so that you don't have to use your downtime for things like that.

The way to reconcile online work and family obligations is to set up a schedule. If you set aside a certain time or a certain amount of hours you will put in to your work or need to put into your work, it can work out. Having a schedule where you can block time for work and block time for family can have these things work in unison. There may be times where it is more beneficial to work on mturk than other times. Finding these times could potentially make it so that the amount of work you have to do can be limited later on. I have also learned that sometimes you just need a way to cool off. There have been times where I have not made as much as I wanted on mturk and had family obligations as well. I came into my family obligations being a little irritable as I felt they were messing up my workflow. In these situations, it can be difficult to find a balance. Setting a realistic daily or weekly goal can give you something to work forward to. It can be motivating to pass this number on occasion as well. There are other options as well.

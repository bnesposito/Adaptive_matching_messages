Online work and family obligations will always be an issue because not every person has the same job or family issues. Some people have kids others dont. What advice i can give is there is not magic formula that you must follow. Find your own equilibrium. From personal experience i have an at home office and at 5 i turn off my monitor and focus on me and my household. Its important to find a physical reminder for that on and off switch. Also with online work there is more flexibility to handle family issues usually. take advantage of that and realize you work for your family. and at the end of the day your family is you boss for life, make sure your family responsibilities are exceeded every year just like your work reputation. No matter how many bosses and jobs you hold you will always only have one family, take care of them first, find your own balance but remember family first. A work task will always be able to be done but your daughters soccer game cant be missed. I am not saying let your work slack, family first and to provide to your family you need to work well. Your job loves your work your family loves you.

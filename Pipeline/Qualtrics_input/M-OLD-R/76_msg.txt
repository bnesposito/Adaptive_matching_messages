Clearly, online work requires commitment and it is important to balance that commitment with family obligations. Three areas I try to think about when balancing the two are obtaining buy-in, appropriate scheduling and sharing rewards.

Obtaining buy-in - Once you have some experience with online work, you have a better understanding of what it entails in terms of commitments and rewards. Reflect on this and share what you’ve learned with your family members. Tell them how much you enjoy it, how you appreciate being able to add value at your own pace and gain a sense of satisfaction from your work. Ask them what impact it’s had from their perspective and listen to their feedback.

Appropriate scheduling - Communication with family members before committing to work each day is helpful. Once expectations are clear and agreed upon, family members will appreciate that you need your own time but you will also make time for them. Online work is fairly flexible so is easy to fit in between other family commitments.

Sharing rewards - Occasionally share your thoughts about your work with family members. Tell them how much your opinion matters on surveys, how it shapes messaging, contributes to social influence research and provides important results for educational research. Additionally, share your earnings so they can see the monetary rewards do add up. Maybe take them for a family treat with some of your earnings!

These are a few ways to balance the online work and family responsibilities.

It's not easy to reconcile online work with family obligations. Family members tend to interrupt all the time with "only a one question" of asking for help with chores or some really small things that make a huge difference in the work process. You can try and make a woking zone and somehow define it with some pieces of furniture or a line on the floor or (it works best) a closed door to eliminate interruptions. Let's call it "isolation". At the same time you want to be connected with your family members and for that I suggest that you share meals with them. You have to eat anyway, Why not do it together and close the door afterwards? This way you will be with your family and give attention to your online work. You can even make lunch for everybody. It's quick and easy and it is usally appreciated. Another thing that you can do is to put on some background music and do some dancing with your family members when your back is tired and you need some movement to keep on working. It can be rather enjoyable. Do you think you could use some of these ideas?

In order to reconcile online work and family obligations, i find it best to be able to make time for both.  here's what I mean.  Multi tasking between home and working online is not effective in any way.  I know it is convenient for family members to ask you to do things or leave the office area for a few minutes to check in on people, but what is happening there is a lack of boundaries.  The healthiest thing is to create boundaries, wither using time or activities to let others know when you are available and when you are not.  For example, being on the phone should be an automatic indicator that you are working and NOT available for family time.  Tell family members that when you have your phone or video conference going, they cannot interrupt unless it is an emergency.  Having clear times and during certain activities and having family members be quiet or not interrupt is healthy because having no limits or boundaries is not effective for work or family.  People need to know that work is a priority during the week and family will have to behave as if you are at the office   I find this is effective and avoids stress and anxiety.

Basically, it all depends on how we manage our work life and family relations the comes to online work there will be definitely distraction while we work at home by our loved once but here where our patience tested and the amount of concentration we are allocating for the work is matter.I usually started online work a while back and initially, I have suffered a bit in concentrating on the work they after a month and so I started used to it and I am doing great I used to get distracted by family member calls for some other things to do so I used to waste some time in that so couldn't do the work properly and I was a bit disappointed and then I realized that this is not the way to do if I continue this way I could lose the work, then I started allocating time and managed to spend on work and other home things by that I used to it and now I am doing great at my online work well this was not only the primary source of income but we can earn a good amount of money through it.so here is my story of reconciling online work with family obligations.

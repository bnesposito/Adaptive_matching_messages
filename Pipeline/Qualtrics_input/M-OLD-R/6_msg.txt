I started doing work online due to financial difficulties about 9 months ago.  I am a homemaker and my family is used to be taken care of; meals, laundry, shopping cleaning are all my responsibilities in our house. Because of that, it was quite difficult when I first started and my husband, as well as my daughter, had to be understanding.  When you work online from home you have to set ground rules not only to others (no disturb sign at a certain time) but also to yourself.  You have to make it as much as possible as if you were going to the office and make sure the people around you understand and respect that.  You also need to take breaks in the same way as you would do if you were in an office; several times when I started working from home I made the mistake of skipping lunch because I was on a job I could not pass!  If you have done work on Mturk you know what I mean, you wait a little too long and the job is gone.  Skipping lunch or not taking regular breaks makes me grumpy and it didn't work too well with my family.  The other important thing is to not be afraid to ask for help from your partner or whoever lives with you, you can not be expected to care for your family as much as you used to if you are sitting 8 hours a day at a computer trying to make money.  All consider it is a good experience and I am happy with it, so are my husband and daughter.

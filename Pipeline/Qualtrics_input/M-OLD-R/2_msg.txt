I believe that you must have organization. You need to have everyone on the same page.  when you are working you need  your family to support that this would be just like you went to an office. This is office time and  you should not be bothered. But you could have a regular meetup with your family at lunch time. You should also follow if work ends at 5 pm that you walk away from  your work and close that door till the next day. Unless of course you have some sort of pressing emergency at work. Your family as well needs to have a schedule that they follow. Like who is walking the dog, washing the dishes etc. Just because you are working from home don't be tempted to do these things if they were already family chores before. Because than you disrupt their schedule things to do. Working onliine at home it is also very easy to go about doing other things. That is why you need to put down I will work from 8-5 to make money. Online work is no different than going to a job, this is how you make your money. this has worked for me so that i concentrate on this task

In today's ever changing world, working from home online has become a normalcy for many. Working online has its benefits and drawbacks. In my experience, it has been extremely beneficial to balancing work and family obligations. 

Working online allows me to have a flexible schedule so I am able to balance work and family life. Working from home allows me to change my schedule or modify the hours I work in order to attend to family when I need to. If I need to drive a kid to practice or a school function it allows me the flexibility to do so. This is very important to me in my life. I had to miss a lot of these opportunities in the past when I wasn't working online. However, I do miss the feeling of going into work and seeing my co workers in person everyday. Now I just see them virtually during meetings. Also, not meeting with clients is hard to get used to since personal connection is important in my business. 

In conclusion, I think working online has allowed me to be closer to family and allow me to accomplish work and family obligations in a very beneficial way.

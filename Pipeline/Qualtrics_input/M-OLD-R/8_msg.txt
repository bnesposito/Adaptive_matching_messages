I think the problem is that others and family do not understand that working online at home is a job. People think just because you are at home you are not working. You have to set guidelines and restrictions that when you are at home working online that you are working. You have to set a schedule that you follow and give it to your family to know that this is your schedule that you are on while working. You have to emphasis that this is your working schedule and you are not to be uninterrupted unless it is an emergency.
But that does not mean you have to be isolated from your family. You going to have lunch during the day so have lunch with your family. Same as taking breaks. Spend time with your family during your breaks. You can be up to date and know what is going on with your family during the day. You still are working but you are also feel like you are part of the family.
Lastly, you have to treat both work and family as separate. Family problems cannot affect your work and work problems cannot affect you family. You must keep both separate so not to interfere with each other.

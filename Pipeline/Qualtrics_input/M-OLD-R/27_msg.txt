Working online has a lot of flexibility and sometimes uncertain set working hours. Its good to take a break once in a while and attend to simple family obligations around the home. Like a 5-10 min break and go do the dishes or take out the trash. Staring at a screen all day can really harm your eyes so a nice break with some physical movement is a good step. Normally when I work I have a routine wake up at 8 a.m. and start working. I eat around 9-9:30 a.m. and feed everyone else. After that sometimes I got for a short walk around the block with my dog.I do not bring my work with me on these short little breaks. I know its not always possible to meet every need that arises while you are working but after 3 p.m. I normally switch off all work that I have been doing unless its paying extremely well. And I go spend time with my family either helping by cleaning or playing games. I like to cook dinner so my partner doesn't have to worry about it. Once I am in bed I do not check work emails or notifications, and I do not check them if we are watching tv as a family.

Like all jobs online work does require some life work balance.  I recently read a letter that argued that this phrase still puts us in danger of doing too much.  If you imagine an old fashioned scale where you put weights on one side and weights on the other you see it is possible to be putting too much weight on both side but still be "balanced".  Instead, the letter writer urged we integrate our life with our work.  This in no way will be an easy task, nor will it make all problems regarding life and work "integration" go away.  It can be hard but using small times throughout your day to do online work may make it easier to integrate your MTurk services with your family life.  I for example used to always drink my morning cup of coffee and watch a show.  Now I instead work on some MTurk HITs or other online work.  
I personally have also gone on to make a list of things that matter to me the most and things I won't compromise for. For example grieving days (like funerals) for people in my immediate family. It will take some sacrifice of family time and personal time to be successful unfortunately but sometimes writing a list of what is really important and what you really need is key.

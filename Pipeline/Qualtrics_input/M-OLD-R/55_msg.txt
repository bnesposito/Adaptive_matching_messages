It can be hard to reconcile online work with family obligations. I would suggest setting up times for work, and times for spending quality time with your family. That way you can earn the money you need to earn distraction free, but also have time to keep your relationships in your family strong.

 I had to do the same thing before, I worked all day and my work/life balance was terrible, and then I stopped working much for family but that meant I stopped making money. Once I set strict and simple times for both of these activities, my work/life balance greatly improved and I did better and both work and family obligations. Now I can work at the peak times online while looking forward to time with my family, and spend time with them guilt free knowing that this time is solely for them. I can go to the park without even glancing at my phone, because it's simply not the time or place and this mindset benefits my whole family.

It will take some time to be strict on yourself and find what times work for you and your family, but one you have it set you're golden. A simple time to work and time for family obligations will let your family know when to expect you to be done and make your work/life balance much better.

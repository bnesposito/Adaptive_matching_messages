I know it will be hard, but you need to try and relax and not let the disruptions get the best of you. In my own experience, I have been interrupted at the worst times, and it has made it difficult for me to continue what I was working on. Sometimes you can't step away. I have found it is best to plan ahead, letting the people I live with know, that I will be busy and unavailable for a small increment of time. It may be inconvenient at times, especially when you're in the work zone, but you will need to step away, take a break and see what the rest of the household is up to, before you start a new work assignment/task. It is not a perfect solution, but for me, since I've had to stay and work from home because of the coronavirus shutdown, it is the only way I can get anything done, especially since I live with elderly parents. There will be times when they forget and interrupt me in the middle of an important task, and it takes everything I have not to be upset with them. I politely tell them, that I need 5 or 10 minutes and will be with them shortly.

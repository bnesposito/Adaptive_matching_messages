An important thing to keep in mind when working from home is to make sure you are properly budgeting your time. It can be extremely easy to lose track of time when you are working from the comfort of your own home, and that can cause issues with your family if you lose track of time and don't spend it with them. What I try to do when working online is make sure take a 15 minute break every hour, and go interact with my family and see if there are things that need to be done around the house, like dishes, taking out the trash, doing the laundry, or taking care of pets. This helps me spend time with my family and helping out around the house, and also gives me the opportunity to refresh my mind in between batches of work. You also want to make sure you set proper work hours for yourself, and try to avoid working outside of those hours. For example, I set a limit for working between 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and I make sure not to work outside of those hours unless I absolutely need to. This helps keep me from burning out, and gives me time outside of work to do things with my family. I hope this helps you figure out a way that works for you!

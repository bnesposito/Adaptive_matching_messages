I always try to do online work throughout the day. I get a good start in the morning and then try to keep going throughout the day. If something somes up with my family they take priority over my online work. I try to make at least 10 dollars a day. I have to be motivated to make money. It can be hard to keep going and to keep making money, but you have to to provide money for your family. If you are just watching tv, i usually do online work as well. But if my family needs me i do that first and then come back to the work. My adive for a american man over 50 years old about reconciling online work and family oblligations is always put family first, your family will nto like if you dont. That is always my goal and if i gt to work online then that happens. My family always comes first over work and making money. they mean a lot more to me then money and that is that. That is what i have to say about my adice for a man over 50 years old and has experience already

Work is certainly difficult to come by nowadays. Being able to work in America at this time is a privilege. Another privilege is having a family to help get us through this difficult time. I believe the only way to reconcile online work and familial obligations is to be very open and transparent. That means speaking to family about how important work is during this time. Express your care and appreciation to your family and try the best you can (while also taking time for yourself to rest) to give them attention and meet family obligations. However, work comes first. Family should be able to understand and support you. Maybe instead of a big annual summer event, you have a group phone call or video chat outside of work hours. I think it is important to remember that these times will not last forever. Scheduling could also help. Utilizing a calendar or scheduling app to plan work times and shifts with quality time with family as well as obligations. This way every thing is transparent. Family is scheduled in as well as work. Just make sure to pencil in some you-time to relax and rest. I wish you all the best.

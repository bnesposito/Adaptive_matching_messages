Working online and also being committed to family obligations is a delicate balance.  While both are important you have to weight the circumstance with the trade off. If you are obligated to an online job for certain hours of the day then your family obligations need to be scheduled around that time as much as possible because you made a commitment to be there for your employer. If your work online has a flexible schedule then of course there is more ability to work your family obligations in and around your work. If the latter is the case, then I think it is important to set goals. Allow yourself a set time for family and a set time for work each day or week. Just like you would schedule a meeting you can schedule family time. That way your family will know when you are focused on work but they will also know that there will be a set time for them. This will hopefully help them feel like you are considering them just as important as your work and also cut down on interruptions while at work. In addition, by setting aside certain family time you will hopefully feel less guilty during the times you are working because you have made a conscious decision about your time that includes both work and family.

While it is difficult to balance work life with family, there are many ways to go about doing this. First, take a deep breath. You probably feel overwhelmed, stressed, and possibly even nervous. Know that your family loves you, and you'll be able to find a balance. 
The first thing you need to figure out is what are your obligations at work, and what are your family obligations? This may change day by day, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. Make a list of things you know you need to do and have done by a certain time at work. For example, a Zoom meeting with your boss at 10 am, I call to a client at 11 am, etc. Once you have a breakdown of what your workday should look like, figure out how to schedule family obligations around that. For example, if you need to bring your grandchild to school, can you make a work call while driving home? Or can you answer work emails while your wife gets ready for the day so you have time to spend together? Thinking about ways to work around your work schedule can be most beneficial so you don't feel overwhelmed.

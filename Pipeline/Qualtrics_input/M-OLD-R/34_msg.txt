In my experience, it is quite difficult to work online and still maintain my responsibilities. A lot of active effort has to be put into time management, more than anything. If there's something that you can't get done in your working time, you have to be willing to compromise and not start to take away time from your responsibilities and family. I learned this the hard way because I would spend hours and hours working on my tasks without thinking about what was going on around me. My girlfriend needed help and I wouldn't be there to help her because I was busy. My dog would need a walk but I had another family member do it because I was busy. My own mental health was deteriorating and I knew I needed to make a change. From that point on, I put a fine line between my work and my home life. I set the maximum number of hours I was willing to work on any given day and forced myself to stop when I would reach that limit. Over time, things got better. My mental health began improving. I wasn't having so many arguments with my girlfriend and I could actually complete my responsibilities and spend time on myself.

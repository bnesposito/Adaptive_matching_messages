Online work can easily take over one's life, mainly because of its near-constant accessibility. When I began performing online work, I soon developed a compulsive need to always be on the computer or on my phone, making sure I never missed an available task. The problem, of course, is that this behavior has an antisocial potential, and others in one's circle of family or friends may feel alienated by the continuous phone and computer use. After a few months of working online, I knew that I needed to implement a strategy to mitigate these effects. Principally, one needs to allot a finite amount of time each day for online work. This could be any length of time, but the beginning and ending times need to be concrete and immovable. It doesn't matter what task may become available on the work platform; once you're done for the day, you're done. Most platforms tend to have busy and slow periods with regard to the work that's available. My advice is to get a feel for these times, and schedule your work hours accordingly. Once I began doing this, I started to enjoy my nonworking hours more because I wasn't constantly worried that I might be missing an opportunity to make more money.

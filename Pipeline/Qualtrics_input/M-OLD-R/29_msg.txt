Ultimately, family relations have to trump online work opportunities. If you can organize your time, however, it is possible to do both. What I do is make sure my family knows that I engage in online activities. Do not let it be a complete surprise that you do some work online. Then, when there is no other pressing family obligations to take care of, consistently work your online job or jobs. There may be times you have to drop a project in favor of a family activity, but family is more important. Children do not stay children. They need you and they need your time. Your spouse or partner needs you too. Even if you only sit and talk. Plus, spending all your time online is not very healthy. Life has too much to offer. 
If you regularly do a set amount of time each day. Consistently and constantly work online opportunities within reason, you will have the success you crave. Opportunity will open to you. Be patient and willing to work your plan. You will not regret it. I know it is possible enen though I do not yet consider myself to be very financially successful. I believe it is achievable.

I have been in this position.  It is best to have a quiet place in the home to work and instruct other family members that you should not be disturbed unless there is an emergency.  If you have children, it is helpful to have established break times to take care of things like helping them with schoolwork, getting meals, and other tasks.  If your hours are flexible, this can also help in setting aside family time.  

If your job includes Zoom meetings and other live interaction with co workers and/or clients, then it is also helpful to have headphones and to be in an isolated area if possible.  I do not advise working in the living room or another similar area where it can be loud or distractions can occur.  You do want to be able to hear what is going on to a small extent in other rooms in case help is needed.  For homes that do not have a dedicated office, a bedroom or similar quiet place might be necessary.  

Also if children are out of school and working from home, I find they tend to sleep in.  This might be a good time to get some important work tasks completed while the house is entirely quiet.  Either the very end of the day or the very beginning has typically been the quietest time for me.

Working online during the pandemic is a necessity for everyone. Considering that you already have experience working on MTurk online work is nothing new and you should realize the advantages of working online. The flexibility in the time spent and working hours provided by online work is unmatched by traditional work. You can take breaks easily and work during times you are more efficient. 

Personally, I experienced a strenuous transition to online work when it first started. I could manage my time properly or spend enough time doing my chores or spend time effectively with my family. But once I got used to a routine and realized that everyone was working online, it provided me with more time to spend with family and take care of household chores. We started spending more time together as a family and had family game nights playing cards almost every night. My work efficiency decreased a little initially but I managed to utilize new digital tools to improve it and spending time around family improved my motivation to work. I managed to complete most of my chores from gardening and helping around in the kitchen earlier than usual since I anyway spent my time at home. Doing household tasks gave me a much-needed break from work when I was struggling with a problem at work. I hope you can also find ways to incorporate online with family obligations soon and be safe during this pandemic.

We know that online work requires attention to detail and the need to avoid distractions so you can do quality work.  Quality and reliability of your online work is the best way to keep getting more online work.  So, I found that telling family about the importance of the online work and how it contributes to paying the families bills helps them understand what extra perks that can be lost if that extra money from online work did not exist.  I would reinforce that I must concentrate on each online task and get great ratings for accuracy and quality work so I need quiet and no distractions.  I need family to stay out of my private office room where I do this work.  I set rules such as, text me if something urgent is happening.  Put a note under the door. Things like that work well to keep control of distractions.  Try doing the online work when the family is sleeping or out of the house.  Try scheduling your online work to not interfere with family meals, family time, or other family commitments.  Show the family why you need their cooperation by doing some work while they watch.  Show them how your online work contributes to the family.

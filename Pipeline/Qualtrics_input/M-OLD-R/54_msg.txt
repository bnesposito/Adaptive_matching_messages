The first and most important step in my opinion is to establish good communication both with your family and with your employer. You should let your family know the times that you will be working so they can give you the space you need to work peacefully. Also, you should let your family obligations be known to your employer so that your managers can maybe tailor your work schedule around your needs as well.

Secondly, I think it would be good to make sure that you implement a strong delineation between work life and home life. It's common for people who work at home to work late or respond to emails when they're supposed to be off the clock. But that can be a source of a lot of tension in your family relationships. You should have a set start time in the morning and a hard stop time in the evening. That way you don't get stuck in the cycle of "just 15 more minutes" when your family might be waiting on you for something. I think that also allows you to be more present with your family when you are spending time with them. Knowing that this time is only for family or work can give you a lot of peace of mind.

Hi
I am sure that you are trying to do your best in a challenging situation as this. I found that the best way to deal with working online is to get up very early in the morning to get a good share of my work done before anyone else is awake. This gives the opportunity to concentrate on my work without being interrupted. Then as the day goes on, if you are needed to help out or deal with family matters, you can do so without feeling guilty or concerned about getting your hours in for work.  There are always things that come up during the day that need to be addressed and dealt with. After this, I suggest a bloc of time that you can work when others are up and about, but understand that this is your time to work and not to be bothered. This is important for everyone to respect as this is your livelihood. You can also set a bloc of time to interact with your family at a certain time of the day. It can be just as though you are at work at times and home at times this way. Structure in this way is best so that all know when it is okay to be with you and when to let you alone

It's very important to keep your family and work life separate. I would advise you to make very clear work hours, and very clear hours for family time.  Don't let your familiy interfere with your working time, and don't do any work activities during time spent with your family.  It's very hard to keep the two from colliding, when you work from home and your family is home all day.  If you don't have a quiet work space, make one. Keep a "Do Not Disturb" sign on your "office" door while you're working, so your family knows not to come in and bother you.  Also, make your work time for when you're most productive and your house is the quietest.  That time for me is very early morning. By the time my family wakes up, I've already worked for 4 hours or more, uninterrupted.  So by doing little things like that, you can keep both worlds seperate, and still find quality time to spend with your family.   If you don't keep things separated, you will pull your hair out trying to get anything done. It's very frustrating when you're not organized and working in a quiet space.  It's also not fair to your employer to pay you while you're not fully paying attention.  Best of luck to you!

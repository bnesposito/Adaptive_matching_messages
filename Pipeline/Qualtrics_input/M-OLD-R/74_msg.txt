My advise to you comes from someone who didn't put proper boundaries between work and family time. My work online required me to be in a quiet, uninterrupted state, and I was able to choose my own hours. Having children, and a husband who worked online at home as well, I was always making new rules. Both my husband and me were irritable and frustrated. My time was constantly interrupted. We finally had a family meeting, during which time we outlined my husband's and my own work time. One of us would always be available at the time our children were home, and we would split all our family obligations equally. The times that we were to be uninterrupted would be posted on the refrigerator, and in the children's rooms. 

A month later, after a few relapses and some frustrated moments, our life became better and more organized. Each of us had our quiet time to focus totally on work, and we all had a fuller family life. Without the frustration of not accomplishing either a good family life or our working obligations, we were a happier and freer family.

It will take some adjusting time, as I said; however, you won't be sorry. Your life will be more fulfilling.

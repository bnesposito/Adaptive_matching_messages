There is no way around it: working from home may cause serious turmoil when it comes to family obligations. How are you supposed to focus on the Zoom conference when you have an eight-year-old running around the house?! Well, it's a little more tricky than many people originally thought, but balancing online work and family obligations is not as difficult as you may have first expected.

The first thing you need to understand is that you have to be mindful of your time. This is the most important factor! If you are working, you are 100% working, not parenting. If you are parenting, you are not working. Not only will this help you to compartmentalize each aspect of your life, but you'll also be able to give more of an effort to each individual task. You'll become a better worker and a better parent.

Second, try to stick to a schedule, but not too much. Interruptions always occur and with today's uncertainty, you need to be prepared to react to things that are beyond your control.

Finally, in order to better reconcile online work with family obligations, you need to sometimes put yourself first. Your mental health should be one of your top priorities, since you can neither be a productive worker or good family man if you are depressed. Take some time for self-care throughout the day to do the things you enjoy without feeling guilty about them.

I'll leave you with one last note: be honest and communicate with your family. Let them know about your struggles and issues; they can help! Good luck, and I hope you can find the perfect work-life balance!

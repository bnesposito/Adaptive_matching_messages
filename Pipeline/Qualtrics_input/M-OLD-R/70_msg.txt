Working from home is definitely worth it. You don't have to commute anywhere and your wardrobe can consist of pajamas (if you're not using Zoom or any other place where they can see you). You can be at home for your kids if you have any, and you can keep an eye on them by taking a break now and then to check on them. I like working at home because I basically set my own hours and work throughout the entire day. Since I have no kids, I can work nonstop if I want to and with my type of work, I can work up until the middle of the night if I need or want to. I also save money by not having to buy gas as much or having to pay to eat out at a restaurant or fast food establishment. 

I am trying to think of some reason why I would not want to work at home, and the only thing is I don't see other people that much or have a personal connection with them as you would if you were in an office. I think sometimes you may miss the interaction with people outside of your family to just talk about things.

However, I think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.

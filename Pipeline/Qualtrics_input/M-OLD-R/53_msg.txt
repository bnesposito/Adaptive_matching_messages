The most important thing for reconciling online/work from home situations and family obligations is balance. I've been working online and remotely for a few years now, and I also have a spouse and a 2 year old child. I work full time and do Mechanical Turk.

For me, it's been most helpful to segment my time. For example, from 8am - noon, I'll work on things for my job. Noon - 1:00 pm, I eat lunch and play with my family, so that I can give them my full attention. After lunch, it's back to work -- my spouse will watch the kid so that I can focus completely on what I'm doing. The advantage of this is that it eliminates the need to multi-task, which lowers the quality of whatever you're doing (be it work or family matters). For Mechanical Turk, this will translate to being able to do HIT's with much greater speed and accuracy.

My last advice is to try not to do too much. For myself, whether through my job or through Mechanical Turk, it can be tempting to just get in there and "grind" all day to chase money. This is a bad idea and will strain important family relationships -- so know when to say enough is enough.

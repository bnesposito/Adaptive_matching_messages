Probably the most important thing is to find a separate space for your work. This means a quiet area that the younger kids or even the spouse should respect and stay out of while you are working. This will give you freedom to concentrate on your work properly.

That said, you shouldn't let work dominate your life either, and you must set boundaries on the amount of time you spend on it. Make certain to stop for family meals if possible. Some families no longer gather for meals, but it can tie you together better. 

And I find it better not to work too late at night.  This can interfere with your sleep and ruin your sleeping rhythms.

Since at-home work is flexible for most, this means you can adjust your work schedule when necessary.  Take part in your partner's interests occasionally.  For example, my brother's wife is an artist, and she has contacts in a lot of different art communities.  This often has her organizing events or attending events he wouldn't normally be able to attend due to work constraints.  But with a more flexible schedule, he can take part. So don't let your work be a barrier between yourself and the important events of your family.

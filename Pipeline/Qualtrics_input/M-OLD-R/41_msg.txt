There are two conflicting, but complementing obligations. Of course, you get paid to work. If you don't work, you don't get paid. this would not help your family one bit. But on the other hand, work is only one part of your day - if working at home, that should really be only 8 hours. There's no commuting, no need to pack a lunch, no need to go out for lunch - can shorten your time and eat at the desk or on breaks. Thus, you need to have family understand that there is a perspective here. But once work is over, you can concentrate on the family. For instance, does someone want to tell you about their day? - you can talk about it. Does someone want to talk about a problem? - talk about when finished with work. Does someone want a ride to the store or a friends house? Say sure, as soon as I can - let me finish my work. I think the family will get the picture. And for certain, your family will be much happier come pay day. Everyone can get what they need somehow in the course of the day and work will be happy to.

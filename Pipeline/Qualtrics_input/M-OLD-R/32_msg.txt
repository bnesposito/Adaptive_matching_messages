I think the most important part of reconciling online work with family obligations is separating the two tasks, both by time and location. In other words, you should have a dedicated location where your online work is done, and you should have specific times set aside for online work and for family obligations.
You must make arrangements for tasks such as child care and meal preparation as well as serving the meals. If you are the only adult in a child care situation, you will have to either hire a sitter or use a day care facility, just as you would have to if you were working away from home. You can't juggle both responsibilities and do justice to either. Meals must be prepared according to a schedule, and someone has to be responsible for child care.
Household chores must be confined to hours when you are not working, and your working hours should be scheduled just as if you were in an office. This doesn't mean you have to schedule work from 8 AM to 5 PM, but you should definitely have certain hours when you are "at work" and scheduled hours when you are "off work". 
You can't be expected to do quality work if you are subject to interruptions, and you can't take care of family if your mind is on work.

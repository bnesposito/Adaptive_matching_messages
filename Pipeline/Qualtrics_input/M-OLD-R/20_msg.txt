It is always good to work in moderation so that you can set plenty of time aside for other things in your life that are of equal or more value. It is essential that we all avoid getting too obsessive in our work and forgetting about other obligations. Working too much can be draining, both physically and psychologically. Others will begin to notice a change in attitude or demeanor, creating cause for concern. People will think that you are neglecting them, even if that is not your honest intention. Now, it's not the worst thing in the world to prioritize work at certain times, though it should go without saying that people are not meant to work 50+ hours a week. It has become so deeply embedded in American culture that hard work almost always leads to success and rewards. That could not be further from the truth. We need to incentivize for systemic change in our workforce, where people should feel just as rewarded working ~30 hours a week as they would working a job that requires them to essentially sacrifice their lives in order to pay the bills and afford basic necessities. It is crucial for future generations ahead and we can be the catalyst for that much-needed change.

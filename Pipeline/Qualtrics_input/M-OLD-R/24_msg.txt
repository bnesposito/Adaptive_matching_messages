It is a hard thing to do..balancing working online at a job, working from home. While I have not done any online work with the exception of MTurk, I have spent a lot of online time answering surveys. I am a caretaker for my elderly mother so a balance is critical to my success. I get up early and do my morning routine which involves helping my mom into the start of her day. I have set times for when I work online that do not conflict with my ability to care for mom. I always take a break at every meal with my mom. Besides those times in between, I work online. Such as when she is watching her shows on television or napping or in bed for the night. It is all about a steady balance between work and family. There should be rules for when your family can disturb you or not. If need be put your schedule on the refrigerator where everyone can see it. During these work times, you office door should be kept shut to prevent potential disturbances. Make sure you go out of your office to check on everyone as often as work will allow.

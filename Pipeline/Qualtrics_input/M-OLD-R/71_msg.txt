You simply have to accept the fact that you are WORKNG. You can't expect family members to accept the restrictions needed to devote your full attention to work, if you yourself do not take it seriously. A written schedule can be posted for family members who are able to read, and a pictorial symbol can be created for members too young to read. A room with a door is preferable, and one that has a method of locking it. The temptation is too great to treat a person in the same manner as they usually do during after work hours or days off, so it must be made perfectly clear that you are working and are unavailable. Incentives may be needed for young children. Perhaps playing with them during a break. Texting should be allowed, but a limit as to the number and length of the messages should be established and strongly adhered to. Perhaps children can be invited into your workspace when you are performing something that does not require much attention, or are waiting for a meeting to start. That gives you and them a reprieve from isolation. Make it a point to devote full attention to everyone in the family immediately after completing your work and are off the clock.

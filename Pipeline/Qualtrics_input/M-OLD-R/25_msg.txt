It can be difficult to balance online work when you have a family who is also demanding your attention. It can be easy to feel that your family should always come first, and while that's often the case, it's important to find a balance to ensure you can get done what you need to. I find that the best way to set boundaries is through open, clear communication. Sit your family down and express to them what you need to make sure your work is successful. Is it a certain number of hours where you can't be disturbed during the day? Maybe it's a private office space, where you can close the door and your family knows that it's important you're left alone during that time. In the same conversation, it would benefit you to also ask your family what their expectations are. Maybe they need more from you, and you need to cut back on work slightly or get better at multitasking. When it comes to family, it's all about compromise, and people understand that no matter what, you still need to work. As with any reconciliation, open and honest communication from both parties is paramount. If you can understand exactly what the needs of your family are, and they can see exactly what your working needs are, you can go from there to create a compromise that benefits both of you. I've struggled with this in the past, and I've seen how what may look like normal work to me can seem like I'm shirking other familial responsibilities. Just because someone thinks so doesn't make it so, but their feelings are just as valid, and it's imperative that you can get to a place that both parties are feeling comfortable and taken care of.

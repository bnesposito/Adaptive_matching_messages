Early in the morning I take a look at my necessary duties for the day. These can include grocery shopping, care for another family member, household duties such as dishes, laundry and cleaning. 

I do best by listing out on paper for consideration and then I will set my hours accordingly for my online work. Some of the duties can be done first thing of the morning and others can be left until late evening. 

There are also time I may take the majority of a day for different appointments that have to be taken care of, then I can set that work up for doing during the evening hours. 

To me it really doesn't matter what time of the day I spend online working since I'm able to set my own hours. It is the planning that I'm able to do that helps me with my time being much more efficient. 

So to sum up how it is best for online working and family, I have one word to describe the process, "planning." Once I do that on a daily basis, then life flows along more easily for me. Once in a while there are exceptions, but planning is the winner for me.

I am very young and because of that I do not have a family of my own so I cannot offer any personal experience in that regard, but I might be able to provide some sliver of value. I think the first thing to evaluate is the nature of the work. Is it freelance work or a more traditional job? With freelancing it is important to set limits for yourself about when you work and when you accept new jobs. Simple rules like not working on certain weekdays or setting a maximum amount of time to spend on jobs each day can help. With traditional jobs it is more difficult because your employer might set certain restrictions that you have to follow, like expecting you to be at your computer for a certain amount of time each day. In general, I think it is safe to say that even with traditional jobs most people will just expect you to complete the task you are assigned by a deadline without too many overbearing conditions. Regardless of the exact nature of your job, it can be beneficial to physically separate your work life from the rest of your life. You should designate a specific area of your home as your "working area" and only do work there. This could be an entire room or just a small section of a room. The important part is physically moving when you start and end your work. This helps keep these two parts of your life separate and keeps them from bleeding into each other. Delineating work from home life is the first step in being able to properly manage them because it gives you a much clearer picture of what you are actually managing.

It is important to meet family obligations however it is also important to meet your financial obligations. Therefor you must weigh the importance of each when making a decision of which should take precedence. For instance if it is a choice between attending your daughters graduation or working online to pay a credit card you should probably accept the late fee and the hit to your credit rating and go to the graduation. Most situations will not be as clearly defined. Maybe you should work to pay your credit card debt rather than help your daughter with her homework. Her grade on her home work is probably not as important to your family as you meeting your obligations and maintaining your credit rating. It is often difficult to weigh these smaller decisions. You should always try to seek a balance between family and work. As you grow older you may find that you regret more the time missed with your family more than even fairly large financial set backs. Each person must decide for themselves what is most important to them. That decision should include input from family members. If you are getting complaints about not spending enough time with your family you should make an effort to insure that the time you spend with them is quality time.

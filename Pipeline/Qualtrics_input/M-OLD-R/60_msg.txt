If you want to take online work while family obligation, balance between work life and home life would be rather integral. You would need to take time out of your day to be able to work and be able to be around your spouse and/or kids. It would be great to pick up an online work job that lets you choose your schedule so it can be flexible. In my opinion, it might be better to do work from home either early in the morning or late at night so you can have all the time to be around your spouse and/or your kids. 

However, I feel like working at night may be a downside on weekends, since that is a time many family members like to stay up and watch movies and relax. Especially since kids going to school have the weekends off and you may have a spouse that also has weekends off if they do typical 9-to-5 work. But if you think you will not care much about the interference, I would say go for it.

I'd also make sure that you have the right equipment needed, since a lot of online work jobs require headsets or a certain build in order for work to be done. I'd also make sure that you have a microphone and a webcam if you pick up a job that requires meetings or your voice to be heard.

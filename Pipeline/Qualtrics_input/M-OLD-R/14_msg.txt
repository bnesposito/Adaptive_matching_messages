Hi!  When I first started working online, I also worried how it would affect family obligations.  I first discussed it with my family and see if the benefits would out-weigh the negatives.  After much discussion, we agreed that we would test it out for one months.  I found time to work when others were busy doing work or leisure activities, so it really did not impact family obligations that much.  There were much more positives than negatives.  I made extra cash and we spent that cash on family activities, such as going to the movies or going out to eat.  As I worked more, I became more efficient and I made more money per hour spent working.  This has helpful, since I have been able to make more money and start paying off some of our bills.  This has taken some pressure off of the family finances with very little impact on family obligations.  I am glad I decided to bring up the topic of working online to my family.  I think it is important to include all in a decision such as this.  It has been a very positive thing and I have no regrets at all about this decision.

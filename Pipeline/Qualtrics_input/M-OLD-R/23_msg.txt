I can tell you what has been successful for me. In order to make sure that I have time for both online work and family I always set a schedule and stick to it. Both are important and you need to use your time wisely. On a typical work day I make sure there is someone responsible there to look after my children while I’m working. We always start our day by having breakfast together so that we can see each other before I need to start work. Since they are home with me all day I also break for lunch with them. It helps them to know I am there and that it’s important to me to see how they are doing. Of course you also need a dedicated and quiet work space where you won’t be disturbed. My children know that if there is an emergency they should call my cell but other wise not disturb me. It’s also helpful that I can schedule my work time around any special events. That way I am always actively participating with my children and the things that are important to them. You have to value their time as well as your own.

I think it is important to balance your online work and spend time with your family. Spending more time doing work may lead to more money or a future promotion, which financially benefits you and your family, but it takes away valuable time that you can use to emotionally connect with them. Your kids will never be young again, and it it is important you spend time with them at that age as they will cherish these memories forever. There is always time to earn more money in your life, but once your kids grow up and move on you can never regain those years. I'm still in my 20's and currently in school, but I make an effort to spend time with my family even though I may have a lot of work to complete. I find that spending time with them helps me mentally and even allows me to be more productive in with my work. I think you should try to spend more time on family obligations and less time on work, you will feel more content and happier in the future. I hope I was able to make an impact on you with my advice today.

Reconciling online work with family obligations can be done if you put into place some guidelines and rules. It is important that you set aside certain times to work and certain times to focus on your family. I would recommend setting up a daily schedule of when you choose to be online and working, as long as you stick to this when you aren't working, you will have time to devote to your family. Make sure while you are spending time with family to not be tempted to log on and get some quick work done. Another thing that you can do to juggle working and family time is set up your workspace in a room or area that is away from others and free from distraction. If you are not able to be distracted while working you can focus on the work and get it done faster. If you set up a routine everyday, it will help you to delegate time to what is important to you. I would recommend getting up earlier than you plan on starting work so you have time to start your morning slow and help your family get ready for the day. It also will help your family unit to spend time together in the morning and eat breakfast and talk about the day ahead. On the other side of things I would make sure to pick a time to stop working so you can enjoy dinner with your family.

Reconciling online work with family obligations can be a tough thing but the reward is worth it. Based on my own experience I would say you need to tackle what the issue is head on with your family and talk with your husband or wife to see where things can be better. You could bring up how you can work from home different and if you need space clarify you need space to work. I am a coder and I have two kids and I work from home and my wife doesn’t and it can be a struggle to get work done because we don’t have a baby sitter and when I get really hard projects I don’t work on them until my wife gets home and then I’ll get an energy drink and then do my eight hours of actual work after that. Some nights can be so tiring but seeing the smiling faces of your baby makes it so worth it. Another way is to ask for space if your partner stays home and you can work on your projects for two through three hours at a time and take some breaks inbetween to refresh. Its challenging to change but change can be good.

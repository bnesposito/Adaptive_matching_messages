When you are working from online from home with family present in the home you have to communicate with everyone each day.  You need to let people know if you will be in a meeting when you will need more quiet or you will be unavailable to help anyone with chores or schoolwork.  You need to prioritize your work above family for some part of the day and the rest of the day you can reverse the priority and devote more time to family. Again communicating to set expectations is important.  When working online remotely you have to careful with work/life balance too.  It is all to easy to work through meals and for the work day to extend beyond the normal hours you worked in a normal office environment.  Checking email and replying to requests after hours can become commonplace and this can interfere with what could be family time.  Splitting duties for different days, like who will cook, who will help with laundry etc. will make life easier for you, your spouse and any children old enough to be learning to be responsible in the home.  Working weekends or on call needs to be balanced too depending on the work you do and what your company and supervisor expect.  If I put in hours on the weekend I try to get some comp time in during the week to keep me from burning out.

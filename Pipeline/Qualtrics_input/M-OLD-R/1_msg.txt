I would say that the most important thing is setting a schedule for yourself and keeping your loved ones informed of the schedule. For you and your loved ones to cope with you working online or at home, it will help them to know when you have free time or time to do other things. They can look forward to it and make plans and know how to keep their relationship with you strong. Something like a printed schedule sheet or a calendar.

Secondly, I would also say it is important to ensure you have a quiet space to yourself to work when you need it. Make sure your family understands it is not because you want to be away from them, but just so you can get your work done and then return to them.

Thirdly, try to be open and honest about your work. Keep the ones you care about involved. The more you do this, the less of a barrier there will be. Sometimes it is hard for people to understand why you are sitting at a computer or laptop the majority of your day, but if you describe what you are doing throughout your usual work days, this will help lessen the gap between you and them quite a lot.

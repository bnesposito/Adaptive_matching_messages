In my experience at first it was hard to juggle between working at home and taking care of the family.  It takes a while to put things in order, so if you have a work at home or considering to have one its a good opportunity. Besides this is the new normal companies understand that they need to be flexible so companies understand that working from home productivity can increase, but workers from home need flexibility in their schedule. For example I work remotely for Shipping.Co
my job is to sent the freight forward documentation, the company understand that working from home was hard for my at firs,  because I needed to handle my house hold.  So what they did was give me a flexible schedule so I good deliver the work at time and as well increase productivity.  So going back to my  experience within a week and a half, I was able to manage between work and my house.Remember that even that we are in a global pandemic Covid 19, there is still job opposites like online working , with the benefit of having the commodity of been home close to family and having a safe environment. If i did manage to handle online work and family you can do it as well.

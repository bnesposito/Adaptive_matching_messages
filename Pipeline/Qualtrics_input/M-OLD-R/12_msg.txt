It's truly hard to reconcile online work with family obligations. I believe that sometimes you have to prioritize one over the other depending on what is more active. Sometimes, you will have more time to spend with your family than you will have in online work. I work a full-time job in addition to working online. The best part of working online is you can stay home and still spend time with your family. What ever people choose to focus on in life will determine what kind of path is needed to take. The good news about your situation is that you might have had the opportunity to set aside a good chunk of money where you can work a little bit less to have that time with your family.
I don't manage my family obligations all that well. I work all the time, so I can make more money now. I make that decision because I want to have more fun during my true peak in life. I believe in sacrificing for the long term. Short term sacrifice will pay off in the future. It's okay if you choose to focus on one or the other, but it should be a decision that is deeply thought about.

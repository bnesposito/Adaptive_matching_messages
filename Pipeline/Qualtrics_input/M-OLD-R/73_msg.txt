Working online and balancing family obligations takes careful balance and a steady commitment. You need to structure it so that you and your family know what to expect. Just saying, "I need to do work" and camping out at your computer isn't enough. Work out a schedule, preferably with your family's input, about when you'll start work, when you might take a break, when you'll eat lunch with them, when you'll be available to help with issues like homework or chores. Also talk to them about what to do if they need you for an unforeseen emergency. Are those more important to you than earning spare change on mTurk?

You also should create your own schedule on what you do online to work. Do more than mTurk because that alone won't give you an income. There are other sites out there, and other ways to create income like freelance writing, or making YouTube videos to help others with tasks that you have experience with. Do you know how to fix a toilet? Reinstall a garbage disposal? Do wood work? Do you have a hobby you love and think others are interested in? Make videos and post them! Good luck in your work and family balance!

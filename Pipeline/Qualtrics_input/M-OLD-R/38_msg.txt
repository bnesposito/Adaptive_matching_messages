Doing any kind of work with family obligations is hard, but when the work is done online, it can sometimes look like you're avoiding your family obligations. While this probably isn't the case, it's important to address any concerns your family might have. I know from experience that when my wife had concerns about what I was doing and whether it was worthy of my time, we waited too long to talk about it, and it drove a wedge between us, unnecessarily. Keeping the lines of communication open will help immensely. Another important thing I've found is to keep a strict schedule, so your family knows when you will be available and when you will be "at work" online. Coordinate this with your family schedule, and be sure to communicate your hours in advance. Another thing I do is share small victories with my wife. I'll pop out into the living room and say something like, "Hey, I'm getting all kinds of work done today. It feels great!" I think she really appreciates when she knows that she stays on my mind even when I'm working. The last thing that's important to me is to stay focused as best as possible. It's easy to get distracted at home. Staying focused will allow you to get your work done quicker and get you to your family life sooner.

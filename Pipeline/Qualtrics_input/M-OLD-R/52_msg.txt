Hey there! If your online work is from home, it can be difficult to exit 'work mode'--because your place of living and place of work have become the same. In this case, it can be helpful to set some boundaries. Give yourself set hours for work, and do not work outside of those hours. If you have the email-checking bug like I do, yes, it counts. As tempting as it is, try to stop yourself from checking it outside of these hours as well. Some apps even have settings that allow you to stop receiving automatic notifications at certain parts of the day--don't be afraid to use them. It can also be helpful to set aside a specific part of the house for work, like setting up a home office in a room that is otherwise not used as often. It's great to work hard, but it is unhealthy to feel like work is overwhelming your time so much that you struggle to maintain the parts of your life that lie outside of it. If you're working online from home, you also have some built-in flexibility available in your schedule. Use this to your advantage. Need to take a 10-minute break? You're in luck, because you're already home. Maybe you can call a family member to just say hi in that time, or take care of some chore you've been meaning to get to. Got a lunch break? If your family lives with you and is also home, maybe you can spend that time sharing a meal with them.

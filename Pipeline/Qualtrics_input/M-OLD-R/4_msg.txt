The first important thing that you can do to reconcile online work with family responsibilities is to establish boundaries between the two.  Do you best to separate them.  Establish a schedule when you will do online work and try your best to stick to it, just as you would with an office job.  It also helps to set up a home office area to work from.  Go there and settle in to do your work, and at the end of your work time leave the office and the online work behind so that you can give attention to your family.  You should also set time aside to spend with your family and take care of chores.  Dedicate that time to them and donâ€™t let work interfere with family life during that time.  That time can be both regularly scheduled hours as well as occasional odd hours when you would otherwise be working.  Just like you would occasionally leave an office job to take a child to the doctor, you can leave your online work for the same types of things.  However, just as you would at an office job, pay attention and try to keep such interruptions to a minimum.

It is tricky to balance working online from home with your family obligations, be assured that everyone is struggling with it and everyone is handling things differently. 

The best advice I have is to make sure you have a room in your house where you can be devoted to working. It's best if you can be able to shut the door when you're on calls or focusing on a project intensely. Even if you can't close the door, your family should know that when you are in the room you are working and they can't come in unless they knock first or ask your permission. Encourage them to text you first so they don't accidentally walk in on one of your calls. 

If you have young kids or a partner that needs your attention often, try printing out your work calendar for them every week so they can see when you have your most important calls and blocks of time where they can't talk to you. A sign on the door that indicates when you're in a call or can't be disturbed can also be fun for little kids to check on. 

But you should also remember that just because you're working from home, you don't need to be more productive than when you were at the office. Set a hard stop time that you'll log off of work. Try to log off early whenever you can to take advantage of this great opportunity to spend more time with your family. Don't work on weekends or answer emails after hours if you can help it, it's important to set boundaries with both your work and your family.

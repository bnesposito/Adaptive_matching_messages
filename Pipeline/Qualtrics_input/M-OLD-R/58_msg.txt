Juggling responsibilities can be challenging for anybody. I think the most important thing is having proper time management skills. Applying them to your life could change things forever. Take notes, learn what you can and when you can. Go for the opportunities that seem a bit out of reach. Get out of your comfort zone. Try some new work, freelance, and find yourself. Especially in this pandemic, things can get overwhelming quickly. But with a solid work ethic, anything is possible. Having optimism is important to self-success. Be kind to yourself and the universe will then in turn, be kind to you. You are what you put out into the world. Making a simple list can change the whole direction of a day. Energy matches its previous owner, and energy is always evolving and revolving around us. Oh wow, this got very poetic. I kind of went on a tangent here. Anyway, keep an open mind, an open heart, and smile. Approach life with optimism and know the importance of time management. Life isn't so rigid, and having a positive outlook can impact not just you, but your family as well. Happiness is the goal in life, for you and your loved ones. Do what you can, but give them some attention too.

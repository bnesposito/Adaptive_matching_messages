To whom it may concern,
     In today's society, the importance of utilizing the internet has become a vital tool in communication with others. Having sessions online has been effective in many aspects of our daily life. The use of reconciliation by way of working online lets us communicate our feelings and attitudes during these troubling times of a pandemic.
     It's become essential to be able to work online, when we are isolated in our homes, and possibly separated from our beloved family members. It is hard when a threat like covid-19 keeps us captive, when our desire is to be social persons who are designed to carry on interpersonal relationships with the vey people we care about, our families.
     It is our duty, as good citizens of our society, to make an effort to maintain our relationships, without jeopardizing the health and well-being of others. This can be accomplished through the dedication and fortitude towards putting other's needs before our own emotional and psychological needs.
     In conclusion, hold fast to the premise that everything works out for the best. Don't be discouraged by all the negative reports bombarding the airways and news online. Reconciliation is a process that takes time, and the internet is a very effective tool in bringing relationships back inline.

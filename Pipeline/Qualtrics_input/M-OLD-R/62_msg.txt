Online work can offer an advantage to reconciliation with family obligations.  You aren't locked down to an exact schedule of having to be somewhere during work hours, which are often when family obligations occur (for example, dropping off or picking up kids at school, school events, etc.).  Online work can frequently be done at any time of day (or night), allowing you to run errands or help family members during the day when normally you would be at work.  Establish a space at home where it is understood that you shouldn't be interrupted when you are there unless it is an emergency.  It is usually possible to get work completed online faster than in a work setting because you don't have to deal with interruptions from co-workers or phone calls.  When working online, you have the option to answer phone calls at a more convenient time.  You don't have to stick to a regular schedule when working online; for instance, your days off don't have to be Saturday or Sunday.  You may be able to accomplish more work online on those days and be free to take off other days during the week in order to fulfill family obligations.  As a bonus, breaks with family are often more fun than breaks with co-workers!

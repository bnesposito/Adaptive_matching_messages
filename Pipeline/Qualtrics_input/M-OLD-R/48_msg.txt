You have to make a plan and prioritize work each day to maintain the work and life balance. When I wake up each morning, I begin by planning out what I have to do that day for work, and how that fits in with the amount of time I have. However, sometimes I will have to modify those plans due to my family obligations. So the first thing I can advise yo is to know what you have to do each day, and make a plan for completing that work. you cant plan too far ahead, because life is uncertain like that. Personally, I do 1 day, but if you are comfortable you can do two or more days. Then, the next piece of advice I can give you is to remain flexible. There are times when I needed to stop what I was doing to attend to a situation that arose, and my entire day was disrupted. But I had planned some flexible time that I used to catch up. Lastly, I can advise you to have a planner or other calendar that you use and stick to. Balancing these things, I think working from home and family obligations are fully compatible.

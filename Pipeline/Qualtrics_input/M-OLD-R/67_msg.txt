Online work should actually be similar to how work was performed before working at home. You need to set aside a place and regular hours where you can devout full attention to getting your assigned, paying tasks accomplished. To this end you must be firm in insisting on being left to work, however tempting it might be to take advantage of your presence. Family will have to continue as if you were driving off to the office to work, and only allow interruptions in cases of actual emergency.  For a good workplace, since we are often involved in online conference a good microphone and Internet connection is needed, if only to make our presence more tolerable to others in your workgroup - think of how annoying it is to try listening to someone talk who has muffled, unintelligible audio or is breaking up. If Internet is not good enough for uploading an audio stream try the cell phone coverage, that is usually good enough in many location. Also be sure to have large enough monitors to hold all your work and a good working position with chair and posture. Once you have all that setup you can enjoy the advantages of working online such as time saved commuting and extra money saved from unnecessary travel as well.

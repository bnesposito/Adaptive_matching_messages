In my current job role, I'm often required to work hours that may interfere with my obligations at home or during designated times that I spend with my family. During the pandemic, I have been working from from 100% of my schedule and this can be confusing for both my spouse and you children. Initially, I needed to close myself off in a room, where I was separate from my family, so I could have quiet without interruptions, but this seemed unfair, especially if i was needed. I was eventually able to find that the work would still be there if I needed to step away to take a break. Breaks were once the time for just myself, but when working from home my breaks are family time. It's time to answer questions about online schooling, making meals, taking out the dog, etc. I've found that life is actually less stressful once I found a good balance between work and home life. Luckily, I work for an employers that believes the same way. It's not unusual to be on video calls and see children or pets stop in for a visit. And sometimes this is a welcome break in what's going on for the day.

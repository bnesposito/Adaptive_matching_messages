I know it sometimes can be difficult  to juggle work and family. I believe the most important thing in life is family. I also know it is very important to provide for your family so they can enjoy life as much as possible. So I think communication is very important to balance them both. It will be difficult but it is necessary. Try and make sure you spend quality time with your family. We like to go to ball games and go out to eat. We also like to get away sometimes and go to places like the beach or go camping for the weekend. When we find ourselves in a rough patch we find it good to get away just the two of us for a day or two. We usually get a hotel and catch a show and go out to eat. We really enjoy just spending time just the two of us. I know she really enjoys theater so I try and do that even though I would rather do just about anything else. I really hope this helps you out. So stay positive and communicate. And it should all work out because it really worth while to work hard on it.

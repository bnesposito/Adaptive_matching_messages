It always seemed like the survey ideas from web sites saying people can make money doing surveys was bound to be a scam. It is actually true because I know for myself that you can actually make money doing surveys. Though that is based on Amazons Turk system. Amazon is reliable, so once found there are surveys to make some small amounts of money you would expect it to be reliable because Amazon does not want a bad reputation with some type of scan. Many other web sites offer the same type of thing in doing surveys and making money, but it has also been shown that they are more of a time waste kind of thing. They guide you through links and you begin answering a lot of basic things, bet they are not simple and asking for extreme info about yourself. You might spend 10 minutes trying to finish 20 pages of questions and then it guides you to a final page saying that you are not qualified. Those are extremely upsetting because I am not intending on wasting my valuable time. Sometimes I feel as if they got the answers they want from you. Once that is completed they tell you that you are useless. I say they get all of the use they want and it's a scam like false advertisement.

Well, congratulations for having 100 hits under your belt.  The most important thing you can do now while your approved hits are low in number is avoid rejections.  There's safety in numbers so I would recommend you take some time and review Turkerview, an online website which compiles reviews and stats on requesters, a current list of open qualification tests, and a daily hits forum.  It is a vast site with a great group of dedicated and experienced turkers. 

I live alone so I am not sure about reconciling online work with family obligations but there are plenty of folks with families on Turkerview as well as on some of the other sites, Turker Nation, Turkkit / Reddit, Turkopticon, the MTurk hashtag on Twitter, etc. Turkkit has an excellent section dedicated to new Turkers with a host of tips. Beware the snark on the daily feed!

I'm a senior citizen and it took me many months to get up to speed.  Once I started using MTurk Suite, jobs picked up, 1000 hits came and went.  Monthly income steadily increased as I found my way through the tools offered by MTurk Suite - Hit Finder, Hit Catcher, and Hit Tracker.  

The pandemic, alas, has increased the number of workers so the competition is a bit more fierce than it was.  Requesters are also undergoing contraction in some areas.  Hopefully as the winter comes on these sources of will stabilize and come back up to speed.  

Good Luck, no doubt you will find your niche on MTurk!

In my experience, you need to make sure that both sides of your obligations stay completely separate.  I set up an office in our basement and shut the door when it was work time.  Make sure your family understands the boundaries that the door signifies.  Tell them that when you are in that room, it is the same as you being off at a job site.  Also, though, make sure that when work is over, you shut that door and be with your family.  You should strive to keep the two worlds from ever meeting.  
It would be easy to sneak down to do some work when you have extra time, or go help with the dishes during work hours, but you can not let that happen.  Get ready to go to work just like if you were leaving the house, and then change clothes again when the work day is over.  Get it set in your mind and your families' minds that the office does not officially exist inside the house and do not let that change.  
Working online is very convenient and safe, especially in this time, but you have to set clear boundaries for everyone and do not let them slip.

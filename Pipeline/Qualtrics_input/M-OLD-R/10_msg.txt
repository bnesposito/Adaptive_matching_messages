I think you should determine whether it is the right thing to be doing. If the online work does not interfere with your family obligations then you should be fine. Online work would be best for family obligations because you can do the online work from home. This will allow you to continue working along with meeting your families obligations. I also feel as the type of situation you are in really matters. If you are trying to focus on work at home but your family is distracting you from getting your work done then you should reconsider the online work. If your family is not full of distractions then you should be fine with online working. I also believe if online work is your passion then you should continue to do it no matter the family obligations. If it is not a emergency then you should not let family obligations get in the way of your online work. So to end this I will tell you that you should follow your heart and do the most reasonable thing. If online work suits your living and family situation then you should continue to do it. If online work is hindering your living and family situation then you should reconsider.

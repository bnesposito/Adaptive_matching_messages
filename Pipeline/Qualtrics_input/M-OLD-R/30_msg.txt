We all have to make money to keep the household going. I find it easy to compartmentalize. When you are working, focus on work. When you are done working, focus on the family. Sometimes that might be difficult; we let family concerns distract us from our work, or we think about work when a family member is talking to us. It requires a certain amount of discipline to keep the two separate. 
This is where habit comes in. If you do something once, it becomes easier the second time. When you do it often enough it becomes second nature and you don’t even have to think about it any longer. 
When you give someone your undivided attention the will respond positively. If you haven’t been in the habit of doing that, you will, I think, be amazed at the difference it makes in interpersonal relations. Likewise, when you focus intensely on your work, you will see the quality of your work improve. The trick, to me, is developing this mental switch.
When working from home I found it necessary to train the family also. I don’t mean train like a dog, that would be insulting, but they have to understand that when you’re working you need to be left alone. Very few things need immediate attention, after all. This is habit also. Consistently is important. You can give them your full attention when you have finished whatever you’re working on.

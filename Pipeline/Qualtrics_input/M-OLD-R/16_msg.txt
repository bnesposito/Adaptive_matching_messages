Working online is the future. To be able to work online, especially from one’s own home as opposed to having to commute to a job and put up with all the office politics and other distractions is definitely a step up.
I would personally work from home given the options without hesitation. 
As for reconciling online work with family obligations in my case, I live alone so there is no conflicts. But for someone with a family I would do everything in my power to separate work from family. Perhaps adjust my hours so when others are not home I can do my work. I would also sit everyone down and explain how important the work is and how disturbing me while I’m working is not something they should do. This will be especially difficult with younger children or babies who have no concept of working vs being there for them. Perhaps this is an opportunity to teach them the differences and to respect other people’s time. 
I would also find a separate room for working if possible. A spare bedroom, an office in the basement, someplace with minimal distractions and some soundproofing. 
It would also be an opportunity for other family members to take on more responsibility for the house while you are working. Let them do the cleaning, laundry, maybe even cooking. 
Having an online job with flexible hours may help as well. Not being tied to a schedule may allow you to handle family matters more easily. 
Overall to me at least, working online is the best way to work. I find I actually work more and get more done online than being at a job. As for working and dealing with family, I don’t see and major obstacles to making it work.

I think the most important thing to do is to evaluate your own personal priorities. Is it more important for you to be there for your family or to be doing online work? What kinds of responsibilities do you have related to your family? Is there work around the house that needs to be done? Do you need to care for children or another loved one who relies on your help to live a quality life? But perhaps your online work does, in a way, partially take care of your family obligations? Maybe your family relies on the money you earn from the online work in order to pay the bills, buy food, or provide a safe home? But on the other hand, maybe online work is more of a hobby that you enjoy doing that just so happens to give you a little extra disposable income? There is no one size fits all advice that can be given. It depends on each individual's personal circumstances. The important thing is figuring out what works for you and what will meet you and your family's needs. Hopefully there is a way to find a good balance where you can do both the things you enjoy and the things you need to do to live an enjoyable life with your family.

When trying to reconcile online work with family obligations, It is good to find balance. I know people that did the work from home thing, made it successful but ignored the family part of the equation. Family is important. Should family members stick around if they are left to feel inferior. ? I've known people who have tried to work from home and had family members guilt trip them in to putting less time than necessary in on building the home business and then failing. While family comes first, providing for family is part of that equation. Family meetings, (plural and all inclusive), to figure out the balances between work and family might be a good idea. Can family members be involved with the work? Can rules be bent for deadlines or family trips? Workaholics can, and sometimes even deserve to, wind up alone if they neglect their family members to the point where they feel unimportant. Businesses fail if they are not given the attention they deserve as well. Many tasks that a single person can accomplish in 30 minutes might only take 10 with only one other person helping. What is the misquote. . ? "Many hands make lite work." Add "Time is money to that equation." Anyway, there are ways of managing time more efficiently to make room for important things in life. Two of the most important being family and providing for them. Those two things should work in harmony.

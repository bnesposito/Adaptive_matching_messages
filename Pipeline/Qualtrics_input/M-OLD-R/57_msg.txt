I likely don't have as much experience with either of these things (online work or family obligations) as you do, but I will try my best to see things from your point of view. Firstly, I think it's very important to reflect on and evaluate your values and priorities, as well as your specific circumstances. Is your online work performance declining, improving, or stable? How about your relationships with your family members - is your work affecting them and how your family members feel about you? And what is the nature of your obligations to your family - how much of a priority is this for you, whether by your own reasoning/desires or by the control of different family members?
Especially during this time, both of these are important to many people's lives. Online work can be necessary to support your family, and being with your family likely more than you did pre-COVID, it's preferable you maintain good relationships with them. Once you can clearly define your priorities, take the appropriate actions to create a balance in your life that supports these priorities. If family is preventing you from doing well in your work, speak with them to express your concern as well as why more focus on work is important to you. If you find that work is distancing you from your family, try to come up with a strategy to manage your time better, and maybe even ask your family for help in this matter. 
It can be difficult to develop a balance when so many things are so uncertain, but I believe with careful consideration, not just on your own but also with the other people involved, you'll be able to work on reconciliation between work and home efficiently.

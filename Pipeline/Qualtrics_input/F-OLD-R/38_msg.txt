When it comes to balance in life, it can be very difficult to achieve. The world is rapidly changing due to COVID-19, and one of the major side effects of it is that many people are no longer leaving their homes to work. Instead many people are now working at home everyday and spending all day around there families. Overall, I believe this is a huge blessing. People get to spend more time with their loved ones and do not need to travel as much. On the other hand, this can also cause tension between family members, as being around the same people all day can get tiresome. When we get sick of seeing our loved ones, it can lead to fights and even cause the relationship to get worse. Some people who work at home have trouble finding a balance between their work responsibilities and the needs of their family. In order to find a balance, communication with your family is key. It is important to tell your family about your work and be open about what you need to do and when you need to do it. However, you also need to make time to spend with your family, so make sure that you have time set apart for them as well. And make sure the time with your family is meaningful. Find something fun for all of you to do together.

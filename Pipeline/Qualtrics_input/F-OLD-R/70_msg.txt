Although I do not work and can not completely give my own experience of trying to reconcile online work with family obligations, I believe can still give my input because I am a college student. Instead of work for a company or someone, my work I have to balance with family concerns my studies in school. COVID-19 has made online work and family obligations quite burdensome for everyone. What advice I would give is to have a structured and organized schedule or plan. This way you can always balance between work and family. Obviously, the plan will not always materialize how you want it to and there will be instances where you need to be flexible. However, what goes into the planning and scheduling is also important. What I have done is let my family and loved ones around me know that I have other obligations to tend to and am not available all the time. I also let them know when I'll be regularly UNAVAILABLE due to work. I live with my family and I also let them know I can't attend to family obligations by closing the door to my room (where I work) This signals to them that I am busy and not available. Unless for emergencies, they respect it and do not bother me. So far, I have been able to keep up with both my online work and family obligations with no troubles through a detailed schedule and communication I have given to my family. I hope this helps!

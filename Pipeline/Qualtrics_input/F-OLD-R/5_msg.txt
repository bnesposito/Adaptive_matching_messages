I know it may be difficult to balance work and home life, but the good thing is with online work you don't lose time commuting to work or interacting with other people in person given all that is going on. I think that it is actually a great opportunity to make money while being at home. It gives you a little more free time interspersed throughout the day to take care of chores. I know for myself I've definitely been able to get stuff off the "check-list" done solely based on the fact that I've physically been at home when things have occurred to me, and it is easy to steal away a few minutes to get those quick tasks done. I know having children probably is a little bit different, as your responsibilities increase and are also unpredictable, but I'm sure they prefer you being around at home to help and understand when you are busy. Ultimately, I think that there are many great opportunities about working online, and there are manageable ways to multi-task. Honestly, there aren't even enough MTurk tasks to take up the whole day unless you qualify for a lot more than what I am seeing.

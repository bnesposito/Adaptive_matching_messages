There are really two important aspects of this question that you need to remember. They are space and time.
You will be more successful if you set aside a particular space in which to do you work. It should have as much privacy as you can obtain. I know it's not easy to do in a household, particularly if you have young kids. You can try to talk to them about setting aside this special place for mom and that they need to honor your privacy while you are working there. Of course if you have a partner at home who can help you police the area then that makes if so much easier. If you don't then I recommend pulling the kids into the routine, giving them responsibility too, including doing certain chores while you're at work.
This raises the other aspect, time. Just like you need to rope off a certain area you need to rope off zones of time too. It's probably best to do this in short spans if you've got kids at home. If not then it's just a matter of scheduling yourself to work. I'm sure you have the self-discipline to do that easily enough.

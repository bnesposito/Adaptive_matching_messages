The great thing about online work is the flexibility of it. That means, if something really needs your attention at home, you can pause or return your work without any penalty and attend to it. That being said, the best way to make money on Mturk is to set a goal and a time frame to reach it within, and then work without distractions to meet it. Communicate to your family or others in your home that you would prefer not to be disturbed while you work. If possible, find a quite private space to work from that is comfortable and neat. Try to keep a consistent schedule and make sure you have the materials you need or might want nearby. That is, if you need a pen or a calculator, keep it near your workspace. If you like coffee or snacks as you work, prepare them beforehand and bring them to your space to avoid getting up unnecessarily. Avoid time wasting sites during work hours, even when you're taking a break, which you should do as often as needed. When there is an opportunity to overshoot your goal, it is wise to go ahead and do it when possible, even if it means working beyond your allotted work time. This will offset days of light workload.

I think that having a work life balance is a very important aspect of getting through life. It is through this kind of balance we can make sure we manage family obligations and also get work done. I think the way I see it is that online work is important, but can be done in ways that do not end up impacting relationships to other people in daily life. Like only working when there are not neccesarily family members around or stuff like that. I think it's important to balance and not always be online for work when loved ones are around to spend quality time with them too.

Another way to reconcile obligations with online work is to carve out specific time for both. So it can be a helpful think to basically set up times you have online work only, and other times you have family time only. I think having that balance of specific time is really helpful. It ends up making you feel like you can have both your online work and you family relationships together. Doing that really helps you feel on target with a work life balance and meeting both online work and your family obligations.

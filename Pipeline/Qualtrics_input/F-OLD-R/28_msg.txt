I reconcile my online work with family obligations by not staying on line all day and all night.  It is only my husband and myself at home so I do my on line work in shifts.  I will work for a while and then take a break and seek him out and spend the break with him.  I will then work some more until lunch time and again I will make sure if I don't have lunch with him I will spend a few minutes with him.  Then at the end of the day I will make sure the evening is devoted to him.  We will prepare dinner together and eat to together and then spend most or a big part of the evening together.  It is important to include your family in your work day.  If you have children no matter what age you have to take breaks and check on them as well.  Or take a break and hang out with them for a few minutes. You cannot just stay on line all day and ignore the family you have in the house with you.  You have to blend both of them together.  Just because you are home and on line doesn't mean you can ignore family obligations. You need a work life balance.

I would make sure to separate times for work and family.  Make sure that work knows that there are hours during which you are unavailable, AND STICK TO THAT COMMITMENT. Your employer may feel that since you are "just sitting around at home anyway," that means you are on call 24/7, or that you have time to carry a greater workload. It may be hard to assert yourself under these circumstances, but you really have to do it. Your sanity and your family's happiness are on the block.  In a pinch, they have to be your first priority.
Your family must also recognize and respect that there are hours when you are working, during which you are not to be disturbed.  This may be especially difficult if young children are involved. Family must understand that your work is what keeps a roof overhead, and/or that working helps you to feel fulfilled intellectually.
It's also important that you take care of yourself.  This will be the hardest thing of all -- carving out a time of day to relax.  Even if it's just half an hour to sit  outside in the twilight, or chat on the phone with a friend, do it.  You're the glue that holds it all together. You have to put the cap back on the bottle regularly do the glue doesn't dry out.

I understand your problem and faced it myself at the beginning of the pandemic! For me, it was making sure I had time set aside for both, where I didn't let them interfere with each other. I now wake up about 2 hours earlier than my toddler everyday (4-5am) and get all of my essential work done for the day. Then I take client calls, check emails and do any small tasks that need to be done throughout the day that don't take as much attention and preoccupation so that I can multitask or jump between my work and my family as needed. Then around 2-3pm I turn off all of my work for the night. I make sure everything is finished up, clear out my email and have my family time. Obviously, everyone at my work knows if it is urgent to call or text me and of course I'll answer then but I will absolutely not check my email until the next morning. I know it can be difficult and my days are pretty hectic, but I know that I'm giving more effort to both my job and my family this way, instead of giving 50% effort to both at all hours of the day.

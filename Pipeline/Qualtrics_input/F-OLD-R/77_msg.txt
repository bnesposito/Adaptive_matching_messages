Working online has made me simple and easy to live.  That too with my kids. I am happy about that.  Only thing is that to be careful of their disturbances.  That too a little kid cannot understand my requirement. I feel it convenient in having my homely food.  My wife also feels it to be very convenient for her to serve. She might also help me on occasions she can. 
My manager expects me more since I have more time at my home. He sends me a lot of work. 
I already do not have a computer in my home and a wifi connection.  For the purpose, I had to buy a computer and a internet connection for office purposes. 
It takes additional expense for me and monthly expense for the internet. 
Before buying the computer and dedicated internet, I felt it was an unrequired expense. But after buying, I feel it to be extremely useful for me to learn additional something to my knowledge for career development and entertainment. 
My wife also uses that for her learning in cooking variety of special dishes. 
Thanks to the online working situation which had brought me many positive things for me to enjoy.

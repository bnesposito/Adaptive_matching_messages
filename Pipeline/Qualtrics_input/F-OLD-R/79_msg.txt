Having to pivot to remote work very quickly approximately 7 months ago was a significant transition for me and my family. I initially found it difficult to balance working in the home with managing my home life. Over time, I have found remote work to be extremely beneficial to my work life balance. I am able to be present in the home which enables me to interact with my family on a more casual, more frequent basis than in the forced, hurried manner we interacted when I worked out of the home. My family has also been able to experience me doing my work and has a better understanding of what I do and how I interact with others, allowing me to be a role model to them. It has also allowed me to be more flexible with my schedule rather than only working within a rigid work schedule. If I need more flexibility within the normal working hours, I can take that time knowing I can easily get back to my work without having to leave the house. I can enjoy meals with my family and save time by not having to drive to and from work each day.Thank you.

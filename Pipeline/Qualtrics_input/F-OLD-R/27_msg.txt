The new norm of working at home and online while balancing a family and their obligations is new to all of us.  If you are working from home the stress you are feeling is normal and when combined with the added stress of also managing a family, well, it can all seem overwhelming at times.  I know how you feel, I do it every day.  I think the most important piece of advice I can give you is to always think of your family first.  Your job is important of course, but nothing can replace your daily interactions with those you love and care for.  If you are doing MTurk work during the day, realize that it is stressful, the pressure to accomplish many tasks every day in order to make money is sometimes too much and I think taking a little break to spend some time each day with your family does a world of good. Remember that the moments spent with your family, whether you have children or grandchildren, or a spouse, the attention and time your spend with them is far more meaningful than completing a task or two for $1.  It is a hard life to balance, but it is good to put it into perspective, which I hope I have helped you to do.  Remember, things will get better, the children will return to School, you might go back to work,  and someday you will look back on this time and say "I did the best I could for my family and myself and I am proud of me!"

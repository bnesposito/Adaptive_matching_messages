I would say that as long as your family obligations aren't emergencies, that you need to block off your work hours each day and not let anyone else interrupt your work time. If that doesn't work then I would suggest mentioning these issues to your supervisor or boss and try and work out a solution with them. Maybe you could suggest breaking up your lunchtime into several smaller chunks throughout the day so you can take care of your family obligations.

I would also talk to whoever it is that is your "family obligation" and try and work with them about it. Maybe you could work together and communicate to come to a solution. 

If none of this works. Then I would say you need to be very very firm about how you have this job and need to be able to have uninterrupted time each day to complete your work. 

Additionally, some of these obligations could possibly be solved after/before work. Maybe if your obligation is to make lunch for your child or children, then you could make their meals the night before after work. You could also try and spend more time with your family outside of work so they don't feel like they need you while you're working.

While online work may be helping to support you, family obligations never stop, no matter what is going on.  I have found that communication is the key to dealing with family no matter what the issue is.  If you must miss a family obligation due to your work online, you need to explain your situation to the family.  My extended family is now the cousins and their families.  We try and get together every 5 years.  I missed the last "reunion" because of a baby shower in my late husband's family.  I am not close to my brother-in-law since my husband died.  When I was invited to the shower I was thrilled and had an inner need to attend to show that I still desired to be a member of the family.  However, my cousins felt that I was turning my back on the reunion and my own family.  Through discussions with my oldest cousin, I got her to understand my situation and she was able to share this information with everyone else at the reunion.  I had to take a long weekend away from my online work, but family ties were more important at that time.  Hopefully I will be able to see all my cousins at the next reunion.

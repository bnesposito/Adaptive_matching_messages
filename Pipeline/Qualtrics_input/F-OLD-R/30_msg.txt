There was a time in college my uncle passed away and I had a project that was due the Monday after his funeral weekend. I had to film some drone footage and make a little video to follow it up. I ended up not stealing, but borrowing a drone from my school for a little longer than I was supposed to so I could shoot some footage while I was at the funeral. Mind you the funeral was being held some 5 states away so for most of my trip it was just driving so I was on real time crunches. I ended up getting some footage directly after all the funeral processions were over. However, this was my last night there and would be returning home at 5 in the morning the next day. I tried to put the video together on my laptop but the video editor we were required to use didn't work on my laptop. The only computer I knew it would work on was back at school. So when I got back to campus the Monday the project was due I tried my best to throw some sort of video together, but alas I failed. I didn't turn it in on time.

Hi, my advice is pretty simple.  Every time you have any spare time search for qual or screener in the MTurk system.  This will bring up qualification or screener hits.  Doing these will expand your qualifications and in turn open up more available work to you.  Also look at the tools that you are using.  There are various tools out there to choose from.  One of the main must have's that became available only a couple of years ago is an extension on chrome (I believe it is also available on other's too) called MTurk Suite.  This is a must have.  The tracker will tell you how many hits you have completed in dollars, there is also a 'catcher' which helps you catch those hits that you want to work on but cannot catch then manually.   The Finder will alert you when a favorite requester starts to post work, this you can customize to your own preferences. You can also adapt this to your own work schedule for searching hits.  One last thing if you are not sure how to use these tools that you find Youtube is a really good resource as there are multiple how to videos posted on this subject.  With all this it will be a lot easier and you will find you can work any time of day whenever you have a spare moment from your own obligations.

When in the early days of working online, there were many different factors that I found that I needed to consider. The first of those is your level of being distracted. For me, this included my personal ability to concentrate based on the level of noise and activity that were present in my work environment and how often I was disturbed from that concentration. Second, I have learned that shutting yourself out to anything, except work, is important to getting work done properly and efficiently. Although, I did not have young children when I started working online, there was always music playing and other noise that could be heard. So, I moved my online work to a quieter area of my home. I also shut the door when noise and/or activity was above normal. This is something everyone has to figure out on their own, in consideration of their own environment. Lastly, I set a flexible schedule of when I wanted to complete my work, while not ignoring my obligation of my family. This was the toughest for me, as while I am at home, I feel I need to be present at all times for my family. So, what I did was set aside a specific number of hours and times each day to work, and remained flexible, if necessary. For example, I may have set to work from 10 am to 1 pm, but had to make lunch earlier. So, I worked from 10 am to 12 pm, made lunch, and went back to work from 1 pm to 2 pm. Flexibility has been a key factor, for me.

It can be hard when working online because when a person is at home and working they tend to get interrupted by family or feel that they maybe need to complete a few chores rather than be doing there work.  I think one of the most important things to do is to set a firm schedule.  Get up at the same time and get dressed and ready for work, this puts you in a work frame of mind.  Have certain times when you tell your family that you can absolutely not be interruppted unless it is an emergency.  If it is not something they would bother you with when you are working out of the home they should not bother you with it now.  Don't be tempted to do household chores during your working time.  Even though it is tempting to throw in a load of laundry, sweep the floor or whatever this takes time away from your work and you need to be focused on that to do a good job.  Also set aside a certain place that you work every day with a desk, supplies etc so you do not have things strung all over the place and not be able to find them.  Family should always be a priority but you need to be professional when working from home.

I have spent a large part of my working life online and, as a woman with a child and householder obligations, I think my experience might be of interest. When I first started doing online work as opposed to in-the-office work, I allowed myself to be undisciplined about the time that I spent on the work. Many nights I continued work until the small hours of the morning It was interesting work. I was a programmer and I was on a voyage of discovery sort of, working out new ways to solve problems. I loved it. Of course, there were a number of unexpected consequences: household tasks didn't get done in a timely way, my entire personal schedule changed so that I was sleeping later in the day and, some days, just not getting enough sleep at all. At that time, there was no software available to hold people accountable: my supervisor simply had to take my word for it that I was working the amount of time that I said I was. Actually, I was so enthusiastic about the project that I racked up a lot of overtime hours. I always felt that there was a shadow of doubt about the legitimacy of the time that I turned in. In later projects, I was more careful to observe normal 9 to 5 working hours. I found it a lot better in the long run.

I would say that the best advice I can give as far as balancing online work and family obligations is making an active effort to separate your working time from your family time. If your job has set hours, fight the urge to work after hours. For example, after 5:15 I shut off my work computer for the day and do not check my email, and devote the evening to family tasks only. On the flip side, from 8:30 am to 5:15 pm I am only doing work tasks. This separation really helps me to be able to focus better at work and on my family. Another big thing that has helped is setting up a real work from home desk that is not in my bedroom or dining room. Having a designated space that is just for work helps me to be able to distance myself from work in the evenings and on the weekends. Finally, I would say the biggest hurdle is to work on telling yourself that it is okay to try different things and see what works for you. Right now balancing work and family can be so difficult, but there are ways that can help make it much less stressful if you put the effort into trying things and finding what works for you.

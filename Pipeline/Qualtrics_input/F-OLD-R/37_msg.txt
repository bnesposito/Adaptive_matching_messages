I don't know for sure if the online work talked about is mTurk but I believe that advice for mTurk is applicable to almost all online work in some shape or form. First I would like to tell you that working online while in the grasp of some big family obligation such as taking care of kids or an elderly grand-parent is beyond respectable in this current trying time. My first piece of advice would be to plan your day the night before. Although this might seem like more work, once you get good at it you can be done rather quick and get back to your evening activities, however planning your day will. make you move much more quickly and effectively. Hopefully, this planning of events you can control will better allow you to be ready and take on events you hadn't expected like something coming up with said family obligations. Secondly, I would take a look at the online work you do and see if there is anyway you could be more efficient or multitask the easier parts of your job freeing up even more time. This multitasking could be learning how to use the software needed better or even getting to know the ins and outs of your workspace. As for me, I currently just do mTurk and practically full time college online so I have taken the time to learn how to use my laptop better and get ahead of projects and assignments by planning my days like I described. This allows me to better help my family by watching my siblings and grandma all while getting what needs to be done for extra income and my education done.

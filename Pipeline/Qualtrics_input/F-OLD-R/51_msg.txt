I would recommend dividing your usual work day into manageable parts, with breaks to allow for the daily distractions that working from home would bring. This will allow you to commit time to your work without distractions while also allowing you time to focus on your daily household tasks.

Furthermore, this allows you to work the same amount of time towards your work tasks, just broken into smaller digestible pieces -- allowing you to be more efficient with your work. The next recommendation would be to create a work only setting such as a study or office which would allow you to isolate and focus. This will allow you to get into the work mindset as opposed to working from the couch or bed which blur the lines between working and being at home. Get fully dressed in real clothes as you would for work to further embed yourself into that mindset and routine. This will help you be more efficient in the time you do work. The more consistency you have and the more continuity you can create between the work environment you have at home and the work you did in the office the better you'll perform I'm general.

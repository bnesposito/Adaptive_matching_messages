As a retired man I thought I'd have plenty of time to do a lot of things.  When money got tight, I decided to pursue doing HITs for Amazon Mechanical Turk, and it didn't take long to know that I was floundering and not making much money.  I've still only been doing it for under a year, but have learned a lot in the process.
First, a person is not likely to make a living doing this.  It will take time and experience to reach a point of making a decent amount of "side money."  It also takes the complete understanding of any family who may be affected by your decision to pursue it.
Open and honest discussion with your loved one(s) is the best approach.  Decide what your approach should be (2 hours a day?  4 hours a day?), set some specific goals (number of HITs per day, money earned per day), and make use of all the forums out there for help (Turker Nation, Slack).  Of course, you'll need to be open to modifying those goals as you go.
Life will help you form your "Turking" level of dedication; always keep communicating with your family and loved ones - they, too, will have helpful suggestions and thoughts about how to balance your new Turking efforts with the rest of life.
Sometimes you have to choose to skip a particularly inviting HIT.  Life is like that - full of difficult choices.  If you perceive each day as a new adventure in Turking, your participation level will eventually resolve itself to the satisfaction of all.

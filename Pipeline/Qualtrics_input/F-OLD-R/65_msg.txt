Working from home can be hard at times when the rest of the family is home, because sometimes especially the kids don't understand when you are home they don't think it's really work. I have had to set limits and defiantly a schedule. You get up each day like your going to work, go to your office and shut the door, the good thing about working from home is you can rearrange your schedule if needed to take care of family and their needs. Your work schedule is important because if you don't have a schedule of your task for the day you could get lost in the shuffle of home life. I also like to work in the evenings when the house is quiet, I can get more done and I don't have a lot of interruptions. Make sure you put a sign up on the door to make sure they know when they can and cannot interrupt you while your working. Get up at least every hour to stretch and look away from the screen every fifteen minutes for at least 30 seconds to help your eyes. Sometimes my grandsons will sit with me and they feel like they are working also and they feel like they are a part of it. Just prioritize your day and it will work out.

Juggling family and work obligations can be tough, especially in this era of remote online working. A couple of pieces of advice I would share: first, make sure that your family is aware of your work obligations and that you have to dedicate time to completing online tasks each day. Write out a clear schedule (perhaps a white board in a common area) and clearly mark out the time you need to do your work. Then you can have your family members do the same. 

Let your family know that you will also mark out dedicated time to spend with them. That might be cooking meals together, reading, or watching television and movies. You could also have them work on a hobby or even start a new one. 

Then you need to do your best to stick to the schedule that everyone agrees on. You probably should find a quiet place or separate room to do your work so that you are not distracted by family members. You might want to invest in an inexpensive headset so that the noise from your online work does not distract anyone else in your family. A standing desk is a good idea, too, so that you can not spend too much time sitting. 

Finally, be easy on yourself and your family. Everyone is doing their best to cope with a strange situation.

Everybody knows that these are tough times and even if they are not sometimes it is tough to reconcile face to face especially if you are far away from your family. One of the best things that you can do is try your hardest in fixing the issues that you have with your family, whether it is forgiving or showing that you are there by going to family obligations. Make sure you try to go to all family obligations that you can and if you cannot make it make sure that the reason why is good. Do not just say that you cannot make something because you have to go to a party because that shows that you really do not care as much. Make sure you keep in mind that family is supposed to be there for you. If you have issues or need help they are the first ones people will turn to. Even if the rest of the family does not help or are supportive you should try to be. Be a good example and think that you help would benefit them greatly if you give it. By showing that you are there and are willing to help you can show more support and than your reconcile can begin.

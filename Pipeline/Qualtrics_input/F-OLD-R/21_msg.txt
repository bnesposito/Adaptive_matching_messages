I had my own online business and successfully worked from home for a few years; therefore, I am fairly knowledgeable on balancing online work and family obligations. It's important to create a work schedule. Just because you're working from home does not mean you should not follow a schedule. Treat it as you would a regular job outside of the home. Otherwise, it's easy to get distracted and do other things. You'll get more work done when you have a schedule and you'll have time left in the day to do other things (whether recreational or family obligations) when you finish! Also, don't have distractions. A lot of people assume that when you work from home you're free all the time, but that's simply not true. It's important to let friends/family know that this is your job, you need to work, and that you'll be able to talk when you are finished. If you have children I'd recommend coming up with fun things they can do alone/with each other while you are working and get them familiar with your work schedule so that they also get used to knowing that this is your job and you need to get it done.

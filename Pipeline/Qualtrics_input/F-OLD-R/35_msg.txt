To whomever is reading this, it is important that you keep in mind that family is important in everyone's life. I know in my past experiences, there were moments where my family were not there for me, but we always looked back and reflected in the past. There is a saying that comes to mind when this happens. It is called to forgive but not forget and I think that it really helps. By doing so, we were able to move on and improve each other's lives by being there for another. Whenever in my family whenever we face difficulties, there is always encouragement in order to be there for each other. I understand that working online along with dealing with family obligations is a struggle to juggle right now. But keep in mind, this will get better one day. I think it is important to note that this is only temporary and the situation will get better for everybody. You should always be positive and be happy about your life. Do not think about the negative people in your life that will discourage you.  I hope whoever is reading this, will be encouraged about online work with family obligations.

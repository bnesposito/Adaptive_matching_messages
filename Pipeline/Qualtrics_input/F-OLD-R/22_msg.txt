Take your time and prioritize what is important between work and family obligations. It is best to create a schedule of what you want to accomplish in the morning, take a break to deal with family and then create a schedule of what you want to accomplish in the afternoon. It is very important that you stick to a schedule and set your targets to improve your overall quality. For example, I take plenty of breaks and will not part ways with my computer until I reach a certain goal that I have set for myself. Once I have reached that goal, I take a break and deal with what I need to deal with my children, make lunch or even rest my eyes. I then do the same thing for the afternoon, so that I am setting myself up for success and using my time wisely. It is also important to turn off distractions. For example, I put my phone away, turn the TV off, and use headphones so I can focus on the task at hand. If I need to step away unexpectedly, I try to return quickly and remain focused for the chunk of time I have set.

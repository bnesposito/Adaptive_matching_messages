I can definitely relate to the frustration of reconciling online work with family obligations.  I have tried lots of different things to be successful in both of these endeavors.  I have tried telling me family between these hours pretend I am not here and do not interrupt me working.  Well, of course we all know how that goes.  I have used a daily planner and made goals for the day.  Of course those always get shifted out of place.  The issue is having me too accessible to my family versus when I am at the office working they have limited access to me. I have finally found what works best for me.  Each evening before I go to bed I make of list of things I need to get done.  Whether it is work tasks, housework, laundry, family..etc...  Then I go through my list and prioritize in order of importance and what must get done the next day.  Once that is finished, I create blocks of time for the next day in my planner and break each chunk into what needs to be done.  I create a estimate of time it will take to do each task.  I never say starting at 10 and up until lunch.  That is just creating a plan for disaster.  I spend my day with blocks of time only.  For example, I block out 8-noon for strictly work.  While I am working away I have created tasks for other family members who may be home and their tasks will keep them occupied and keep them from interrupting me while I work.  As a family, unless the house is burning down no one is allowed to interrupt my working.  We have agreed as a family that at noon- lunch time, we will regroup as a family and check in and see how everyone's day is going.  This system has drastically reduced my stress levels, I am much more organized and I feel in control of my day, instead of having my day and my family pull me in every and any direction they feel like.

I find that people think that online work is not the same commitment as working in a brick and mortar establishment.  The mindset is the same regardless of where you work. If you work in a brick and mortar and need to utilize child care or other services to take care of family obligations the same should hold true if you work online instead.  Keep the baby sitter or family member around to help with family obligations and keep working from home.  American woman put a lot of pressure on themselves to do it all.  No one can do it all by themselves.  If you have no one to help you I would suggest making a space for the children to be a part of your online self.  Their own work desk with a bulletin board for them to use and a list of projects they can work on while you are online working.  A bean bag chair for them to read it and take naps in.  This is such a great teaching moment for children to see their parent working and achieving work success.  So many people do not share with their children what their education is for and what they can achieve if they obtain a degree of higher learning.  They can also be taught that getting that degree could mean the difference between doing endless work on mturk and getting a better paying job that gives one a better sense of self worth.

Hi there! I know that navigating working online, or working from home, alongside other familial obligations can be quite challenging. I believe that with the right protocols and boundaries in place, you can create a comfortable and productive work environment that will ease the challenges of working from home. First, create a set routine and schedule and stick with it. Make sure that all of your family members are aware of the routine you have in place. However, your schedule won't work if you choose to not abide by it. Consistency is key for any major change to happen. You could start by staggering each week with one additional, small change in your schedule. So in week one, you might have hour long blocks set up for you to work, and by week two, you will implement hour and a half long blocks. Additionally, making sure your family has their own schedules in place will be of great help. I find it  helpful to create a consistent morning routine that involves non-work activities. You could spend 5 minutes journaling, 20 minutes stretching or exercising, and 30 minutes eating breakfast with your family. Making sure to have family activities embedded in each day's schedule will also help create structure and boundaries for when it's time to work online. Lastly, don't be hard on yourself if you make mistakes, or lose productivity when shifting to work online. Nobody's perfect, and this transitional period of working from home is challenging for everyone!

First of all it's important to realize you can do this successfully! I'm going to share three key points that I think you can incorporate daily. First it's important to have a designated space. All family members need to understand the space is reserved just for you to do your work. So what I'm saying is you are setting a boundary with regard to your working space, it's also important to establish boundaries with your time. Whatever works for you you can choose a designated time and be certain to work exclusively during those hours. Or if you prefer you can post your hours allowing yourself some leeway. It's important that family members check those posted hours so they'll know when you're available for them and when you are exclusively working. Since time is short my third key point to part with and take away is to be gentle with yourself. None of this is written in stone so if you lose sight of the goals periodically, just reset them! Think of all the people that don't have the option of working from home. One thing to help you to stay on track would be to keep a calendar where you can record your accomplishments and success! Be well!

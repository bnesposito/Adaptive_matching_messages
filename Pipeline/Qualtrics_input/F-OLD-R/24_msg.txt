I like to think of Mturk as an extra source of income. I like to spend time on it for a few hours a day but I don't overdo it. I also like to take breaks in between. Some days are slow and some days the surveys just keep pouring. It is important to know that you can't just spend an endless amount of hours scrolling through mtruk for surveys. It is important to know that mturk is no an actual job you have to clock in and out every day. Mturk gives you the liberty to choose your own schedule. With this in mind, it is important to know that there are other obligations. Staying on mturk all day is not going to take care of those obligations. You have relationships to maintain, a family to be with, a family that needs you. I would not want my family to feel like I don not have time for them. I want my family to feel loved, I want the hem to feel wanted. It is important to earn money, yes but it is also very important to not let go of your family's obligations. Family is what matters most.

trying to balance online with with other things like family can be tough because online work can feel like it is always with you. this is unlike regular offline work where normally you would show up to your office, spend your day there, and then leave the office. once you did that, your time at work was done and you could feel (hopefully) that you had the rest of the day to spend time on your other obligations. with online work, this line can be blurred a bit. because you no longer have a strictly defined line, or process, or commute, or whatever, separating your work from the rest of your day. my advice would be to try your best to pick a time where you decide that you are done with any online work and use the rest of the day for your family and other obligations. if this is not possible, maybe talk to your family and get them to understand the issue you are having and let them know that you are trying your best to fit both things into your day. i think you should at least be able to find a comfortable middle ground with them.

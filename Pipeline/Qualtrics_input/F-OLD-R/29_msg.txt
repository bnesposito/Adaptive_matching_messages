It is hard to balance your freelance, online working lifestyle with the schedules of the family members around you. It is even harder than work-life balance for traditional workers because people don't ever seem to fully understand it. However, we don't need to achieve full understanding; we just need to get your family to understand that your work is important and requires absolute focus. Just because you are at home and seemingly available for conversation and chores does not mean it is appropriate for them to interrupt you while you are working. Explain to them that your focus and complete attention is the most important part of your online work and that any distractions can be a detriment to your performance and reputation on the online working platform. Personally, while I do not have any family, I set time constraints on my online work because otherwise, I would never feel that I was "done." I will work for a few hours in the morning, from whenever I am ready to start until 7:30, and I will work for one hour at lunch, and I will work for three hours after work. If your family knew your schedule, they may be more considerate of the boundaries between your work time and your social time. Many people seem to have a hard time with logging back on to work after they should have been finished for the day. I have been guilty of this when I have gotten emails inviting me to closed qualifications and the like. I will admit, sometimes it is worth it. But maybe for your situation and need to compromise with your family, this should be a hard boundary. Good luck!

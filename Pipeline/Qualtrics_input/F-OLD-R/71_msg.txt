For me, it has been an easy task to do online work while having family obligations. I set up two separate sessions, in one day, to do my online work. I do one session in the morning, after I've done breakfast for my family and for myself. If I have more house chores to do in the morning, I postpone my session for a bit longer. Postponing has never affected how much I earned online. I usually do about 1 to 2 hours of online work in the morning, and then do the same thing in the night time. Just like in the mornings, I do online work after I make dinner for my family and myself. Again, if I have business to take care of, I do that business first and then go to my night session of online work. In total, I spend about 3 to 4 hours doing online work a day and this schedule that I've created has never impacted me negatively. It is easy to follow this schedule and it gives me a lot of time during the day to earn, at most, $100 to $150 dollars within a month. I could comfortably earn more during the day, as I have time to do another online work session during the afternoon after I return from my outside work. But I choose not to, for my own health and because I feel like $100 to $150 a month is good enough for my household. Anyone can do it, as long as you set up a schedule that you are comfortable with.

If working at home with a family, I would say the first thing to do is establish firm (but not concrete) work hours.  The family, and especially children, will learn that this is time when you must pay attention to work.  It also teaches them that when work time is over, you will be there for them.  If you have young children, it might also be a good idea to schedule breaks, so that they learn that if they wait a bit until you get a break, you will give them your attention at that time.  Second, I would recommend putting together a dedicated work space that the family learns is for your work, and not to be "trespassed" into.  l did that for a sewing area when my children were young.  Though I still put scissors and sharp, dangerous objects out of reach, it did teach my children (after a bit of time) to respect the space.  Lastly, if you have young children, you might put together some art or craft boxes with coloring books, yarn, crayons or toy car and truck boxes.  If you put them in another area of the same room, you might get the kids interested  in having their own "area" where they can see you but remain occupied with their own tasks.

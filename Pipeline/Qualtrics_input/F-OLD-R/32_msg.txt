Hello I have been working on mturk from home since 2017. I find the best way to possible way to balance work and family life is to set a strict schedule. I wake up at seven am and make coffee then work from seven thirty to ten am. Then I walk my dog for twenty minutes to get him active and let him use the bathroom. Come back home and cook some breakfast then resume working at eleven. Then I check my chore list and see what I need to do around the house that day. On most days I have to clean one room of the house at least and run a few errands. I take a break from work at one pm and run any errands I have to get done then I come home and clean. I resume working at three pm and work until six then I call it a day. After that I cook dinner for myself and girlfriend. Then it is time to relax and unwind from the day this is very important to not get burned out because it is tempting to work at night but I have done this and get tired of working when I do.

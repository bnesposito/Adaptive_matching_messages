It would be beneficial to structure your day in a way where you dedicate blocks of time to specific activities/ responsibilities. Depending on what is convenient, you can set aside time at the beginning, mid, or end of day to do your online work.
Then, in the free time you have, you can find some time to dedicate to spending time with your family and doing whatever it is you need to with them. If you can stick to a schedule, then you and your family will know what to expect.

That aside, it would also be good to communicate with your family clearly so you and them both know what to expect. You can explicitly tell them how much time your work requires and then they can tell you how much of your time/ attention they would like to not feel dismissed or ignored. Once you know both of these things, you can find a balance where everyone's needs are met.  It's hard to be disappointed if you know what to expect and what's being reasonably offered to you. This is the sort of conversation I had with my family some time ago and we haven't had these sort of issues anymore

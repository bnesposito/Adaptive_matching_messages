Work and family matters are both important aspects of one. In times like these, when more people are working from home, it is good to have balance a healthy balance between the two just as one does when working remotely. It's especially critical that one does not neglect family time because of too much work, especially when others, such as kids are dependent on you for socialization time. However, that's not to say that one should cut down too much on working, which could jeopardize one's financial situation, making the situation even worse. I think that helpful thing to do in such cases, is to have a talk with family about how much time one is planning on working and when one will have, if any, breaks during the day. In this way the family can anticipate when is a good time to talk and spend time whit you. You should also take into considerations your family members' obligations not just yours. In terms work efficacy, it would be a good idea to set up a separate work space in the house to avoid any interruptions while working. Overall, just work out a god schedule as if you were working remotely, that works for you and your family.

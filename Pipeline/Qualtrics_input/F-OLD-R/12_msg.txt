The best advice I can give about reconciling online work with family obligations is to manage your time and use your time effectively. Many people consider both work and family to be top priorities, and it can be hard to feel like you are doing your best to manage either of them when you're feeling overwhelmed. In my experience, setting aside specific times to work online helps be to be productive and efficient. If I have an important meeting or deadline to meet, I will alert my family in advance so that they know not to bother me (unless of course, if there was an emergency). Since working online is often done in your home, with the family nearby, creating a solid boundary between your work and home life is absolutely crucial to finding a balance. If possible, it helps to have a separate room (or even a designated space in a room) where you will work. I have also found it extremely helpful to make schedules and set goals for myself for the week and beginning each morning. This helps me to hold myself accountable and prioritize tasks, which can be difficult when you are working online. Overall, I find creating a distinction between your work-life and family-life is most helpful, whether that be in boundaries through space or time.

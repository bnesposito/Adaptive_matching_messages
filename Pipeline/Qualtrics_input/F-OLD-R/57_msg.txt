I understand your dilemma. In spite of the strides women have made in world (e.g., voting rights), to some extent, we are still made to feel guilty about being career oriented. And at the same time, women who choose to be homemakers are shamed for not wanting to work outside the home. So in some ways, it a "damned if you don't, damned if you do" situation. However, what other people think of you is none of your business. More importantly, their opinions shouldn't matter. With that said, the only way to balance work and home is through trial and error. The is no right answer for everyone. You just have to feel your way through and listen to your inner voice, your family and the people you interact with online while working. Each will let you know when you start bringing work home in a negative way or start bringing personal issues to work. And when it happens, and it will. Know that it's OK. You're human, and you get to make mistakes. However, you also have to be willing to do your best to find a happy medium. And if you can't do it on your own, don't be ashamed to ask for personal or professional help.

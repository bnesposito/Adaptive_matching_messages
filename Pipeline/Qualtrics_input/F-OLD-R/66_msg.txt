Working online at home and fulfilling family obligations at the same time can take some effort and discipline.  Think of it as having a job outside the home.  If you worked outside the home in an office job, you would be there approximately 8 hours each day.  If you can get into the mindset of working online at home but working without interruptions during that time, you will be successful.  You cannot put off your work obligations to pursue family obligations.  Unless there is an emergency, you must concentrate on your online work.  Family obligations such as dinner, cleaning, laundry, sports, etc. will have to wait until your work obligations are finished.  Mixing online work and family obligations throughout the day will not be fair to either.  One or both will suffer in the process.  Setting aside a quiet work area, perhaps a separate room, office in the home, etc. will help keep you concentrated on your work.  Obviously most in-office employees have a lunch break during the day.  As an online worker, a lunch break could be the time to take care of a small family obligations such as starting dinner.  But this should not be a time to completely stop your obligation to work.

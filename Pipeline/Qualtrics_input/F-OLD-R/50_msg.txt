I would say that  when we were working at our job site there was a work life balance that was expected from the employer such that we met action items and completed projects. Our family would get whatever remaining time was left over. I think now with the capability to work from home we can almost set our own schedules but I think its important to establish a good balance between family and work. I would start by sitting down and drafting up a personal schedule that you can use to block out time for work and for family time. I don't know if it rings true for most, but I am very routine driven so my advice would be to establish and follow the schedule. It may take a couple revisions to your initial draft but once you strike a satisfactory balance between time devoted to work and time devoted to family it should eventually feel like there is some normalcy back in our lives. 

Another critical element of a successful routine is to create the separation between your family space and a work space in my opinion. Its easy to become distracted by the daily happenings around the house so creating a work space within the house that provides an environment for you to focus is critical. I would set up a room where I'd place my computer and work desk which would allow me to shut the door so I could have that separation.

I think it is all about dividing your time. Whether you are a mom of four, or a college student studying and trying to make money, dividing your time is key to making your life run more smoothly. Also, sometimes life is about sacrifice. I believe that there isn't enough hours in the day. I used to not think like this, but when I started working along with going to college, I really had to evaluate my time because there wasn't enough time to go to class, study, eat, work and hang out with friends. You need to think about your future and what you want to do. Managing your family and your career can be hard but there are so many people in this world already doing it, that you can too. You can look to those people for advice. If you are a mom, look to mommy vlogs and if you are a boss business women, go find mentors who lives resemble yours. Just don't give up on one or the other. You are able to make it work. It might take time and effort, but most good things do. Decide what is most important and sacrifice what is not. Put your best effort in, and I'm sure it will all work out.

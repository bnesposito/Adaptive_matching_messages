Reconciling online work with family obligations is sometimes quite hard and could be sometimes great its like a mix match. You have to set up time for your online and stay focused on that for a couple of hours and then you can do the family obligations afterwards and this is very similar to me. People need to set aside differences in how they are going to work and then take care of family time as well to. Online work can actually sometimes be beneficial because you get to work from home and you are already home with your family in the first place anyways. You don't have to go anywhere and the family is already with you in the same place. That means if they ask for help on anything that means you are already there with them in general. The family time can always come after you set the work schedule for yourself and then the work of the house can happen afterwards. The timings between the two can be sometimes quite hard but you have to find a way to actually make that work. I do the same type of work online and what I do is that I set up my work schedules first and then I have to find time for the house and family work afterwards and keep everything organized into the correct timings. Being organized and knowing the times will help you feel better about yourself and it will also make you feel very professional as well to.

Because of the times we live in, its not always possible to work out of the house and be able to be attentive to family at the same time. I was facing this dilemma recently, and though work was willing to oblige because they valued my talents and obligations, its hard to make things work in harmony. 
First understand that there are two parties that have to equally appreciate what you are doing, and agree that this is doable. without family understanding that working is a way to pay for the comforts and necessities to live, and that work understands that family is the bases that uplifts you to a higher stranded to work harder so you can show them the appreciation of better living, then it'll be ok. This can work in harmony. you can do this so long as you have a family and a job that support and appreciate you for who you are and what you can do.
I know in These times of Covid 19 that there are a lot of firsts that are happening that we've never seen in our lifetime. I as well am in my 50's, and I know that if we can persevere through this by working at home in balance with our families, this might just be the new norm for everyone.

I would ask my family to look at my time doing online work exactly the same way they would look at time going away to a workplace for the same amout of time every day. They should view it as a block of time in which I am legitimately unavailable, except in case of an actual emergency. If I were at work in a factory or office, they would take care of routine tasks on the assumption that I was not available to help, and would not be available until I got home from work. If an unexpected situation arose, they would handle it themselves if they could because they understood that bothering me at work or expecting me to interrupt my work for a non-emergency issue would be unreasonable. On the other hand if someone else in the family works outside the home and it's necessary for me to do family or household tasks while they're home, there should be a clear agreement on exactly what's expected. For example, there might be agreement that I schedule some routine tasks between periods of work, or that I only do stuff that can't be put off and postpone the rest to be shared by everybody when they're not working. Either way, the goal should be an equal division of total work plus household activities so that nobody feels taken advantage of.

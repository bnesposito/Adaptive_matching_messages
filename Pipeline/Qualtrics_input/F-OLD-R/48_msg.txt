I have been working on MTurk since 2017. In addition to that, I also work online as an editor. Although I do not have a spouse or kids, I am responsible for taking care of my 81-year-old parents. They do not need round the clock care, but they aren't totally independent anymore and need help with various daily tasks, such as shopping and going to appointments. I have found that the key to balancing my work with these responsibilities is to plan ahead. If I have to take my mother to the doctor during my peak work hours, then I make up for the lost time by putting in a few extra hours at night. One of the great things about MTurk, and about my editing work as well, is that there are always jobs that need to be done. I am not tethered to a traditional 9 to 5 workday. Since Fridays tend to be slow, I try to schedule family duties on Fridays or sometimes on Saturdays. This is also when I take time for myself. I have found that I need to pace myself when I work online. If I try to do too much, I get burned out. So keep that in mind when you plan your schedule.

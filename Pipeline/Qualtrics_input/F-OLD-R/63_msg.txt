I understand how difficult it can be to try to balance online work and time with family. You need to make money and sometimes others may be dependent on you to do so, but if you spend too much time doing that, family and loved ones may start to see you as a stranger or someone that only wants to be left alone even if that is far from the truth. I spend a great deal of my time doing online work because I desperately need the money, but it's important to do everything in my power to make time for family too.
My advice would be to set a solid schedule for when you need to work and when you can stop for a while. I would suggest only working for about two hours at a time. You can have multiple blocks throughout the day that you set aside for online work, but keeping them rather short will make sure that you still have time for family in between. I'd also suggest being a little flexible if you have to. Maybe family dinner is running a little long and cutting into your work time. Don't worry about it. Instead of getting up and leaving early, just make a note to work for a few extra minutes afterward. Work is important and something we all have to do, but we don't have to sacrifice family to do so.

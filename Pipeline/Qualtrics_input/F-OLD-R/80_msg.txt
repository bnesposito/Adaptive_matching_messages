I have been working online doing transcription and completing MTurk tasks for a couple of years. Thankfully, I am able to choose the times and amounts of work I choose to do each day. What works best for me is getting my chores done early in the mornings, and working mid-to-late mornings into the afternoon. But I have done it the other way around at times. You just need to figure out what works best for you. I will take small breaks to check on the laundry, walk the dogs, etc., snack and bathroom breaks, and a lunch break. I usually finish up by three or four o'clock in the afternoon and make sure everything is neat and tidy before my husband arrives home. Sometimes I will have put a meal in the crockpot in the morning so as to not have to worry about cooking dinner in the evening. But more often than not, my husband and I cook dinner together. That is just something we have always done and enjoyed together. I don't have children in the home, so I can't really speak from my own experience on that. I do, however, know women with children who do manage to work online from home. So I know it can be done!

I would just set a schedule. The work online is easy. A schedule would allow you to make the work even easier. It would also give you a definite advantage over working at an office at some location. Comfort is key in this. With comfort, you can reconcile with your family. What do I mean? It is easy. If you are comfortable at work, you are comfortable with your family at other times. So, maximum comfort is maximum good times with your family. You should try to do everything you can to get to the maximum comfort level at work. Just try to do the easy things first, like the schedule I first recommended. Then, go for the hard stuff that will take some time or weeks or something. Either way, comfort will get you there with your maximum family goodness level. If you still have problems with your family goodness level or reconciling, I would see a professional. They pretty much always work. And, there is the a specialist for just about every type of problem. You can also talk to them about just about anything. It really is good. They are there if you need the extra push to get reconciling.

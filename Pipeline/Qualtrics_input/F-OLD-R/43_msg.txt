Striking a work-life balance is difficult for everyone, but even more so in this new time of working from home. I find that it is useful to have a designated work space in your home. This allows you to separate your home activities from your work activities even though they are transpiring in the same location. It is also helpful to have a schedule of when you will complete work activities and when you will complete home-related activities. I find that it can be overwhelming to try to do everything at once. Coming up with a schedule that set aside time for work, relaxation, household chores, and more was extremely helpful for me. I also made my work space comfortable, but not too comfortable. I used a comfortable chair and made sure not to work from my couch or bed. This helped me focus on my work, as well as put some distance between work and home, despite them sharing a location at this time. If you have other family members in your home, it is important to communicate your work schedule and any expectations you may have. For example, if you have an online meeting, communicating this with the other people in your household can ensure that they are quiet and not in the video frame, if that is your desire.

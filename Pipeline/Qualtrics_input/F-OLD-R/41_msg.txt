I know that is hard to balance between online work and family obligations. I think it is important to always put your family first. They are the people who love us and support us the most. Of course work is also important, but it should always take the backseat to family. When it comes to online work, a schedule is the key to success. I know what hours are best for me to work. I set aside family time throughout the day as well as breaks to not get overwhelmed. From my own experience, it is best to be as flexible as possible. You never know what the day holds. Some work days are slower than others and that provides us that special time to spend with our families. I think it is all about balance at the end of the day. It is always best to work as hard and as efficient as you can. Additionally, setting daily goals is good as well. Not being hard too hard on myself when things don't go my way work wise is easier said then done. Overall, I think being in such a comfortable position to make your own money is the biggest blessing!

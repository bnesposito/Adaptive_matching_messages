well to be honest, i am not 100% sure what they are asking here but i will take my best shot.  I think you are asking how one goes about MANAGING their online work priorities when they have family obligations?  For that I would think that the majority of Mturk and us free lance and gig workers can relate to that.

I recently took a 6 week trip up to another state to help out my daughter with her grand kids over the summer.  they are 4 and 7 so cannot be left alone.  And i did not want to lose all of my work while watching them so i had to create a schedule for us that we all agreed on.  I worked M-W and watched them Th-Sun.  this was we both were able to get the things done we needed to get done work wise.  The family has to accept your work obligations and realize that you have to have time to do the things you need to do work wise.  The best way is to set up a schedule as you would if you were working a 9-5 anywhere else I think.

I hope this helps you!  th

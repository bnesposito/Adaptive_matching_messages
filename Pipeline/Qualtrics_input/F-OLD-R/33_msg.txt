In order to reconcile family obligations and online work, you can start off on the right direction by having a sit down meeting. Use this meeting to discuss family values. Do your family members value solitude? Or do they prefer social interactions on a regularly scheduled basis? To facilitate this conversation effectively, you may want to to talk about love languages. Some love languages can include acts of care, or gift giving, or words of affirmation, and many more. This can help guide the discussion as you ask each family member: Which love languages do they prefer to receive? Which do they prefer to give? Once you have a general idea from each of your family members, open up the discussion to a practical and honest evaluation of your available time. You can even set up a family-shared Google calendar so everyone can see which blocks of time you need to work, and which blocks of time you might be available for family activities. This way, they can have clear communication about your limitations and availability. Even better, they can add in their own scheduled events and you can even join them in any activities that they choose to initiate! Good luck, and may the discussion go well for you and your loved ones.

Remember that the reason you work from home is to be with family.  So do not let work take over every second of your life. Set times when work is not to be done.  Also, make time to see people outside of the house  Socialize, go out to do errands.  Meet with friends on occasion.  This will give you a break from being home on a continuous basis and give you perspective on your situation.  When you are with your family, try to do meaningful activities.  Set up routines and traditions that you enjoy as much as possible.  The key to a work-life balance is just that, balance.  Yes, work and earning money is important  But remote working cannot be 24/7 working.   Do not let media, television, social media and computers be substitutes for your presence in our family's lives.  Do things like gardening, home improvement, walking, traveling and leisure activities as often as you can.  When you decide to work from home, choose a company or a business that affords you flexibility or asynchronous working arrangements to facilitate family time.  And take time for yourself and make your home a haven for you and a peaceful retreat as much as it is a workplace or hub for your other family members.

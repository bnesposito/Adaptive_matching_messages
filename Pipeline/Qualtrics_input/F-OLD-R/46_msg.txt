This is a situation I can relate to very well!  Family members and close friends can sometimes have difficulty understanding that you may be home, but you are working and need to concentrate x amount of time. Obviously, it's good, if possible, to have a quiet room or spot away from the rest of the house, and even better if you can close the door. Let your loved ones know you'll be out periodically and can talk briefly during short breaks. Also, I'm a huge fan of multitasking.  Working from home allows you to put on something for dinner and let it cook while working; same with laundry. Helps if you view these things as 'exercise' (feel free to roll your eyes!) It helped me when I got a fitness watch. Housework or cooking breaks can be good because you're up and moving around, which is crucial to do regularly if you work at desk work.  Show your family that you're as much 'there' for them as ever! Resist the impulse to keep working, if you've put in a full day, and tend to be a workaholic! On the other hand, if everyone else is doing homework or their own thing in the evening, it's great to be able to get online and work a little bit. (But please do either enable the 'night light' feature or get blue-light blocking glasses, or you might have trouble getting to sleep.) Speaking of sleep, do try to take good care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well,  drink enough water, not too much coffee or alcohol. Try to get some exercise outdoors every day, or most days..  a walk or a jog can help re-align a body that's been hunching over a desk most of the day.  Have flexibility, a sense of humor, learn what works for you, and you don't have to be perfect! You'll learn what works best for you as you go.

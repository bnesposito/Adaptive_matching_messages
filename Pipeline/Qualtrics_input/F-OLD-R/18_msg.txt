Balancing working online and family obligations is a doable challenge.  The needs of my family will always come before the work that I do online.  Taking care of my family is important to me.  I love my family very much and will devote as much time as needed to meet their needs.  That being said, I am a woman in my fifties who also works on Amazon Mechanical Turk part time.  I will get up early to see what HITS are available for me to take.  I will find free time during the day to work on available HITS.  My work on Amazon Mechanical Turk is also an important part of my life.  I am a homemaker and the extra money earned on Amazon Mechanical Turk is a true blessing for my family.  I take my MTurk work seriously and always try my best to submit good quality work.  My family is very understanding of my time spent online working.  My children are older which does help some because they are not little children anymore.  I enjoy taking care of my family and also being able to work online in my spare moments of time during the day.  Taking care of my family and working online gives my life joy and a purpose.  The balance of online work and family obligations is something that I enjoy very much.

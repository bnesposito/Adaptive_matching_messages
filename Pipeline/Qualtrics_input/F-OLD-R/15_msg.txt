I have been working from home online for many years. When I first started working online from home, I had three teenage children living with me. I think the most important part of keeping the work/life balance in check is to really emphasize to yourself that your online job is really a job. Some people treat it like it is an interruption to their family life, but I always had a designated place to work and everyone in my family was aware that if I was in my working space that I was AT WORK. It also helped me to get up in the morning, shower and get dressed just like I was going into the office. I also kept to a strict schedule for breaks and lunch. Every hour I get up and stretch and walk around for a few minutes to keep from getting tired from the screen time. I also resist the urge to work too many hours. I log my hours into a spreadsheet every day to make sure that I am not going overboard trying to get things done in the evening. I try to log off at a reasonable hour, eat good foot and make sure that I get enough exercise. Good luck to you!!

The most important thing when working online is to organize your time appropriately.  Anticipating when your busy times will be is important.  For example, when my son is going to school, I make sure that I am relatively free at the time the bus drops him off so I'm available if there are any hiccups in that routine.  He may be coming home on a bus, but I know how things can go awry even with that routine.  And, he might come home to tell me that he needs to go purchase supplies for a school project, or maybe he's having trouble understanding a math concept.  And, don't try to be a superhero doing EVERYTHING and being successful.  Forgive your mistakes and allow the house to be cluttered for a day if necessary.  But, first and foremost, remember what is the most important to you.  Yes, you need extra money, I'm sure.  If you are working Mturk, that is all it is so find something else if you need to pay bills with it.  Still, it can be enticing when you see a period of time that multiple high paid Mturk hits come out and you might feel like putting the family stuff aside.  But, REMEMBER WHAT IS IMPORTANT.  Most people who work at home are trying to balance family with work, with an emphasis on family.  Don't lose site of that!  Let some of that work pass on by rather than neglect the ones who are most important to you.  You might feel a little regret for not making the extra money, but I guarantee that is better than the guilt you get from waking up one day and realizing you were not there for your family.

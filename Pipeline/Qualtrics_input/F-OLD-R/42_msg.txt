Having a daily planner is very important. Writing the things you need to do everyday will help you stay organized. Whenever there is family obligations, make sure to write in your planner to do extra work the day before you have to be with your family. That way you never get behind on your online work. You can also speak with your family and let them know your online work is important. If your family is constantly calling you to help them out with something, that can keep you distracted from the work you need to do. Inform them and let them know what is going on. Make sure you don't ignore your family, when it is something very important. Your online work can wait because family comes first. As long as you stay organized and do not get behind on your work, you won't have a problem when it comes to family obligations. It can be easy to get lazy and not want to stay organized, but that will just end up impacting you in a negative way. Stay on top of things so you never get behind and also make sure to always be there for your family.

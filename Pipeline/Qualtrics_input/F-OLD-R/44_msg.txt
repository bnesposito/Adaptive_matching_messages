I know that it can be really difficult to balance work obligations with family obligations. This can get even harder with online work because you are around your family while you are working, so it becomes a bit harder to separate the two. There are a few ways to work on balancing these things that I have found helpful. Firstly, I suggest claiming a space that is your own in your house. This could be your bedroom, the porch, a chair in the corner etc. Let your family members know that when you are in this space, you are working. If you have a specified space for working, it will likely be easier for you and for your family to allow you to stay focused. 
It is important to stay focused and do the best you can while working online. You should take whatever steps you can to be as focused, calm, and steady as possible when doing online work. However, it is also important to create boundaries. Decide on what your work hours are, and stick to them. If you want you can change this time every day, but once you decide work is done, it's done. Make it clear to your co-workers that you are unavailable once you are done working for the day. Working from home doesn't and should not mean you are always available. If you are firm about this, you will be able to have more time to spend on family obligations. 
One more piece of advice: don't be afraid to ask for help from other family member and friends who can spare the time. Online work can be a new and difficult experience so don't feel down if you need some extra help.

I find it best to separate my work life and family life as much as possible when I’m working for home.  First, I always work in a private room away from tv, radio, or other distractions.  Secondly, I maintain a exact schedule just like working in the office.  I will take my lunch break from noon to 1 pm and also take two 15 minutes breaks during my 8 hours of work.  As a side benefit, I keep my dog Harper with me in my work area as my loving companion. Having a pet definitely helps in lowering my stress level.  This is something I could never due in the office.  I can also have an added benefit by working in sweatpants and a t-shirt while at home. This definitely saves time in the morning and give me time to prepare my children lunches before starting work at 8 am.  In past weeks, I have also been able to start doing my laundry during my one hour lunch which gives me more family time after 5 pm.  In review, for me, I think the biggest key is to ensure you have a private, quiet place in which to perform your work assignments.

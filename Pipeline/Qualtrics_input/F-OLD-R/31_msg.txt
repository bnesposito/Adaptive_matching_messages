When working online I find it is best to treat it like a normal job. What I mean by this is you should wake up, take a shower, and do whatever else you would normally do before going to work at a physical location, this will help with productivity. You should also schedule how long you're going to work similarly too. From my experience it's best to wake up early and get all of your online work done with as soon as possible. That way you'll have more free time you could use to spend with friends/family and do chores around the house. I usually wake up around 6 AM, brew some coffee, take a shower, and start working around 6:30. Working 8 hours I get done around 2:30 PM. I tend to take a break every couple of hours. Sometimes while I'm on "break" I will do some chores around the house like putting a load of clothes in the washer or cleaning the toilet or something that doesn't take that long to do. I usually don't take a standard lunch break during this time and just snack or eat a sandwich or something light while I'm working. After I finish work for the day I have plenty of time to do more time consuming chores or spend time with friends or family. I also have been cooking dinner instead of ordering takeout more lately too.

Online work like any online activities can be addictive.  I find I need to balance my screen time even if it is work related with family time or else my spouse and children will feel left out and frustrated.  Family time is very rewarding. When I spend more time playing with my kids and doing activities it has huge benefits. I notice they are happier and then will often go on merrily playing with each other and reading and doing learning activities with much more vigor.  We can consider family time as having long term benefits and s being worth the time and investment away from money making activities.  Our kids will grow up stronger and less likely to tend to bad unhealthy lifestyle and behaviors.  Often times I find that I can catch up on work activities after the kids are asleep and I can even better focus my attention and be more productive after hours.  I've adjusted my schedule to have family time when they are active and get my work done when I am not as needed by my family.  This is a double win.  I get more work done as I am less distracted.  And I can be with my family when they are most active as well.

This is really challenging. You feel guilty because you need to earn money and yet you also feel guilty because your family should come first and they have needs. You need to treat it as a day job. Set an alarm. Get up. Go the space to do the online work and make it clear to everyone what your working time frame is. Perhaps you establish a time limit (i.e. forty minutes of work; then you will check in with the family to see what's going on). Or, perhaps a longer stretch works best for you. Everyone needs to know you are working from 10-2 and should only be disturbed for emergencies. You know the obligations that need handling for the family - you have to pencil that in to figure out the hours that can be given to your online work. 

From my perspective, early morning and late at night has been best for me to do longer assignments for work. I am less likely to be disturbed. Middle of the day, I have a lot of interruptions so my focus is distracted and that's not the best way to work. So I will only check in on work if I know I have a solid window of time to give to it and I will only accept shorter assignments at that time. 

Family can be unforgiving when it comes to wants and needs. Maddening almost. And they don't always understand your goals. So I say set that clock early - get it done in the morning. Crawl into bed at night, and get some more done. Then whatever else you can fit in during the day can be treated like gravy. And you get to give your family the attention they demand and need without feeling guilty. Hope that helps!

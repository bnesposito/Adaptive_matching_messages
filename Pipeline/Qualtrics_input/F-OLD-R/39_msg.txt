After realizing what I had just been asked I would ask just a couple questions to get a slightly better idea of the situation. Regardless of why he is in this position he obviously loves his family and is willing to make sacrifices for them, if he is like the majority of people I have met. I would ask if their is any possible way that a happy medium or middle ground can be reached. If it would be possible manage either the time for family obligations with your family in order to accommodate work that could be a potential solution. Explaining the situation to your work superior could also get them to allow you to take care of your family obligations before work on certain days. While one of these two are ideal scenarios, we know that life doesn't usually work out perfectly. Now comes the difficult part. If one of the two have to be made a priority I would have to say that being there for your family is something you will never regret doing. On the other hand picking a job over family, depending on the scenario, could lead to you not having contact with family.

I would say that there are several things to consider when working from home and taking care of family obligations. The first thing that I do is choose my time to work when the rest of my family is otherwise occupied. I wait to start until I have prepared breakfast and gotten everyone settled into their day. This makes working from home much more doable. 

The second piece of advice that I would share is that the person who works from home must be able to switch tasks without a lot of difficulty. Let's face it, emergencies happen that the person working from home must deal with and being able to switch what you are doing is important.

 Probably the most important factor that makes up a successful online worker is patience and a positive attitude. Things go awry, and its best to not be too hard on yourself when they do. You will have good days and some that are not so good but overall things generally work out. I enjoy my online work even with the interruptions and dealing with family drama. Overall it has been a positive experience for me and one I plan to continue to engage in.

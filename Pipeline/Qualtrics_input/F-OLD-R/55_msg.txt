It is certainly challenging today to reconcile work and family obligations. I would like to share a few tips have worked for me. One thing that helped me is effective organization. Use a calendar to manage your time and organize your week. Prioritize urgent, nonurgent,  important, and unimportant tasks. This has helped me because it places all tasks in a hierarchy of importance and urgency. Everything begins with a foundation of organizational structure. Another thing that has worked for me is using formal childcare services. Look for affordable childcare because it is more reliable than unpaid childcare and it will support the structure of your workweek. Another thing that has helped me achieve a work-life balance is flexibility in working hours. Ask your employer if they will work with you and allow you to work hours that best suit your family life obligations. A good employer will often work with you if you reciprocate by being a loyal valued employee. Telework from home might be an option. This frees up b time that would otherwise be spent commuting to work. It also allows caregivers to be near children or elderly parents. Increased autonomy in scheduling and working from an alternate location may help if teleworking from home is not an option. I hope some of these tips work for you.

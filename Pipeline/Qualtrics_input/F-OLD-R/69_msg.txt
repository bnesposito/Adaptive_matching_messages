Well if you want to reconcile online work with family obligations you're going look for outside help to maybe help you out. For example, what I did to calm the storm between my occupation and the lack of attention I was giving to my family was bring a coworker over to my house to have a discussion with my parents about the sacrifices I was making at work. Through my coworker, I was able to settle the tension I had with my family members and make more time to work through my website where I also have Zoom meetings with colleagues. I would heavily advise to also shorten the hours of work because working for massive amounts of hours can be detrimental to family time. Maybe find a way to do both at the same time, like go to your family event while holding a Zoom meeting through your phone. Avoiding conflicts like this one are huge and can sometimes cost you your job and family's respect. Lastly, you might want to let your boss know of the problems you're having, he might help you settle some free time with family members. In conclusion, don't mix these two things together if you plan to have a functional life.

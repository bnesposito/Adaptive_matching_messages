I'll admit, it's not that easy to find a balance between work and family, regardless if it's online or not. It's something that I still struggle with. For instance, I work a day job, but I also spend 4 or 5 hours a day doing online work as well. I am married, and I have a 3 year old daughter as well. Luckily with my regular job, I work different hours and work mostly before anyone else has woken up yet. By the time I come home, my wife is always happy to have me home, because we have a toddler and she's a handful, and my daughter is happy to have me home, because she loves attention. My wife wanted to be able to stay home with our daughter and so I knew I would work more to make sure that was able to happen. I only have so many hours in a day. And again, finding the right balance is hard. What I have found works, is that I mostly work where my daughter and wife can get to me. I don't close myself off unless I'm doing something that requires that usually. I try to be flexible. I also try to do the majority of my work while my wife and daughter are out, sleeping, or doing other things. That way my work isn't cutting into my family time as much. We have set hours where I don't work as well. You know, we make sure we eat meals together as a family, and I always am willing to drop what I'm doing to help my wife get dinner ready, or any other amounts of things done. Flexibility is my main key to balancing the responsibilities. But I've found that for the most part, online work is the easier thing to be flexible with. So I put my family first, and work my online work around it. Talk to your family about what they want and expect from you, and work around your online work from there. Good luck!

It is very convenient these days that we are able to perform work and earn a salary in our home without ever having to worry about a commute, dressing up, or competing with others in an office environment.  While we can do this quite successfully it sometimes puts us in a conundrum when we are tempted to do things for our family throughout the day that we wouldn't be able to do were we in an office.  For instance, if you have small children you may put off writing a report and instead, help your child finish a puzzle, read a book, or feed them lunch.  While we are able to do all of these things when working at home, we must decide which is truly important.  Of the three that I mentioned, it would be NICE to read your child a book.  NICE to help him or her with a puzzle, but ESSENTIAL to feed him or her lunch.  While working from home, it is important that we always remain focused on our job(s) and our work obligations and avoid becoming distracted with our children and/or family diversions.  If you do not have children, however, much of these temptations will not occur and our family obligations become only those that you may take time off from the office to perform anyhow.  For instance, your husband needs to see a cardiologist and you are worried for him -- do take that time off to be with him no matter where you might be -- in the office or at home.

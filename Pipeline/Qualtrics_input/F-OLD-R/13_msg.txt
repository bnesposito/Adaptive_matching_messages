I would advise you to keep a really good balance between your work life and your home life. I would recommend focusing on one or the other carefully, without allowing the other to break your focus. This requires setting some boundaries. I would limit the number of hours you work, and also attempt to limit the number of interruptions by family members while you are working.

I can't say that I have always been a good example of this. When I work from home, my office door is usually open. My kids approach me often during the day. Depending on what I'm doing and how worried they look, I often allow them to interrupt me. I don't want to hurt their feelings and tell them to leave me alone. But, my children are very sensitive so life is always a delicate balance.

I will try to give some concrete advice. Use a good headset when you are working, one that blocks out noise in the house. Close the door to the room where you are working. When you are done working, be done for the day. Do not look at your work computer again, or your phone if you get work messages on your phone. Focus completely on your family at the end of the work day. Give them your full attention and love on them. They are really what matters.

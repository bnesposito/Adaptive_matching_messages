Reconciling online work with your family obligations can be fairly easy, as long as you set and follow some guidelines.  I have been working from home for 22 years and I love it.  First off, work should be treated just as if you were going into the office and you need to establish a set start and stop time and adhere to it.  You need to ensure that you are not interrupted during those times, except for emergency.  You need to have a separate room/office to work, not on the dining room table or living room sofa.  You need to be able to close your door during sensitive discussions that your family should not hear.  If you talk on a phone for business, you need to have a separate line that the kids or family can't pop on, listen in, or tie up.  It needs to be dedicated for work.  You should take your normal breaks and lunch time.  Spend lunch with the family if they are at home.  After getting used to the routine, you may find that you are able to manage some other things during working hours, such as starting a load of laundry before work, and then on morning break, move it to the dryer, and at lunch time, remove it and put it away.  You need to get up and stretch - you're not in a prison.  Occasionally, it is nice to take your equipment outside in nice weather and work from there if possible, but be sure to avoid distractions.  You are working, and that should be your primary focus during working hours.  Remember, at quitting time for the day, log off, get up and leave your office.  Don't say you'll just finish a few more things - think of it as leaving the office to pick up the kids or something like that - it is a hard stop that you must adhere to.  These tips should give you a great experience.

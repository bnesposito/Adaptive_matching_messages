It should be easy to get people to work online from home when they have a family also.  I would tell them to take their time with on-line work and to work at there schedule around their families schedule.  That should be easy enough to tell a person that because that way they can take care of their family and also do on-line work.  They can take care of their personal obligations and go on-line and do some work and make extra money.  I do this right now all the time.  I am not taking care of a family member but I am helping to take care of my sons puppy.  She is a little corgi puppy.  She is only seven months old now.  She is a very spunky, naughty puppy.  I need to watch her all the time because she gets into all kinds of trouble.  She is in that puppy stage where she is chewing everything in sight.  I have a few cats, so she is constantly chasing them all around the house.  I let her have her fun for a few hours, then I will set up a puppy play pen that I bought. I put her in there with all her toys, so that I can get on-line work done.

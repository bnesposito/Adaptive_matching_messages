I have been working from home since March due to COVID 19.  I work for Dominion Energy as an intern in the business systems management department as a business analyst intern.  My father is also working from home, but my mother is still going into work.  I do not have any children and live with my parents so I do not have to schedule out much time for anyone but myself.  I was in college and moved home so it has been different and I see my parents more often because I live with them.  I have had an okay time adjusting to online but I do not have a good work space and usually have to sit on my bed and work.  My dad has an office set up, and we usually have lunch together around noon every day.  It has been nice being at home and being able to spend more time with my family because I am working from home. I do not have many family obligations because of every thing going on right now so do not feel as if I need to specifically schedule time for anything particular.  I do however feel as if me working from home has brought me closer to my parents because I would no tbe living at home if I was not working from home.

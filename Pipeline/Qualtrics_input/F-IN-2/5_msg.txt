Busy moms who want to stay home to raise their children, but also want to contribute to the family income, have many options for building a flexible home based career. Review your personal and professional talents and interests to determine if any can be turned into a service that you can provide virtually. Some service ideas include writing, editing, and proofreading, reviewing legal documents, bookkeeping, graphic design, virtual support, and more. One major advantage of online working is you will save time on commuting from home to office. In major cities, this is a real time burner. For example, I’m from Chennai, and here people spend more than 2 hours every day traveling from home to office and vice versa. Since I am doing online work, I end up saving 48 hours every month on commuting. Not to mention that I also save the hassle of getting stuck in traffic. I know a friend who lives in regret. Her mom was sick for months and since her job was the office job, she couldn’t spend much time with her mom before she passes away. This is just one scenario but there are many other situations when you definitely need to be home with your loved once. Or, better if there is no reason and you are a family person who loves spending time with their wife/husband/children/parents or any other. When you are work in online there are no travel expenses, no expensive company meals, and no expensive formal clothes for the office.

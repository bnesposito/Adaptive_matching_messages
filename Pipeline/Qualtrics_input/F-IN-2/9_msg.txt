It can be difficult to balance working online and family obligations. I think it is easy to think of online work as easy or not very time-consuming when it can actually be the opposite. It can require absolute attention and a great deal of time, depending on the work. At the same time, family duties can also be demanding and just depend. There are times I am working on MTurk in the evening and a task runs long. My husband is waiting on me so we can go get dinner. Or like the other day, I was doing a long HIT while my sister was trying to talk to me. I feel bad ignoring the people around me that want my attention but completing my work on MTurk is also important. 

I think it is good to set goals and be realistic. Be flexible with your schedule and if needed, let a HIT go if you simply don't have the time. Taking care of family and being present at home is arguably more important than doing a HIT on MTurk. And there will always be more HITs online. I always have to remind myself that there will always be more opportunities available and to not get caught up in MTurk so much.

I find the best way to reconcile online work with family obligations is to set a schedule and follow it as closely as possible. I designate a certain part of the day for working. I ask that my family do not disturb me when I am working. However, they are allowed to contact me for emergency purposes. Also, I allow them to text me a quick question regarding things that need to be addressed immediately. I discussed these requirements with my family before I started working. Also, I give them task or chores that should be completed therefore they know what I expect them to do while I am working. I usually check in with them at the beginning of the day before I start to work so I can address any situations before I am busy. 

The second thing that you must do is carve out some time to spend with your family. This time should be used to talk and bond with your family. It will allow them to feel special and let them know that they are important to you. I will usually eat dinner with them and we discuss what happened today or the current events of the world. Basically, I believe the key to reconciling online work with family obligations is to set a schedule and prioritize your family along with your work.

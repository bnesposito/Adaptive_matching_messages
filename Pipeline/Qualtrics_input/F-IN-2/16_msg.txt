Hello,
          Recent changes in society forced the employees to do the job  from home other than from office, It made many hard situations in the daily lives of everyone working. I am doing my job from home and i know well, what are the difficulties we face. As you are a women may be a wife  working make it worse. The daily routines are change and controlling of each and every member in the family also a big  headache. In my case i'm using a schedule to arrange all the duties of one day that i am going to do. I start my day from morning five and it ends night ten. My family members also cooperate with me to do control my working hours.
                   My working hours start at ten in the morning and it continues to lunch at noon and between this i can help my wife in some daily routines and food making ,because of the flexibility of my work . If your job is not that flexible take room as an office lock the door and do the job, instruct family members do not disturb. 
             You can come out from the room and take some rest with family for a fixed time and go again close the door and do your job.

Talk with your family and explain to them that this is work, and you do need the time to do work just like you would be if you were employed outside of the home. Like all work you need an schedule, and stick to that schedule. Also inform you family of that schedule. With working online you can be a tad more flexible. Ask you family  if they can inform you in advance of the obligation that you need to attend to. Schedule and a routes is very important  in everything to run smoothly. Nothing is perfect and be aware that things need to be adjust here and there so every one can find a nice balance. Be understanding to their feeling and ask them to be understanding towards your as you, and your family find a nice balance that all are happy with. Always make sure that you let family know you love them but they need to make sure they understand work is important to you and it is something that you need to do. Sometimes sacrifices are needed, but  with communication those sacrifices should not become a regular occurrence. If they do make sure to have a sit down and to finger out how to prevent it.

I used to tell myself that online work is the coming norm and it has turned out that I was right.  Beyond this pandemic,  online work will be the wave of the future.   So, if you have been doing it and still are, you are riding that wave.  As far as reconciling with family obligations, I feel that it is a lot easier to do so when your workplace is in your lap.  Freedom is what you should concentrate on and use that freedom to structure your life, more efficiently around what you do.  You can weave the various threads of your family life into a more intricate and rewarding whole by skillfully scheduling and improvising your time and actions, make your daily life a piece of art, deftly fitting in all of the various pieces, leaving nothing out and adding willfully and skillfully.  In the coming years, there may be societal divisions based on whether or not you have to commute to a job or do you stay at your home to work.  Online work may be the aspiration of the many. 
Family will become an even more precious thing because you can be around more when home and w8is the same.

Please take the time to prioritize your each day and put first things first. Some days you are going to make more than others but you must be willing to make time for family and your children relationships above all else. This is living with intentionality and purpose. Be sure and decide that each of blocks of time that you set aside to work each day include a prioritizing of your HITs as well. Look at the amount of time each HIT requires if listed and communicated. If the payment is less that 10 cents a minute then be sure it is a quick HIT and not one that will not waste your time. Also, as you are doing HITs be sure and stand up and move some to keep your stress levels low and a little exercise going. When it's time to fix a meal or be with family place stop and walk away. There will always be another HIT to do but you cannot get that time back for relationship with your family member. You will feel better and thank yourself later concerning keeping your commitments to proper priorities with your family and loved ones. This takes discipline, but in time will work.

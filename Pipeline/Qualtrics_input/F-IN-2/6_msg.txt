hi there, if you are trying to find balance withing work and your family. i would choose slowing down or cutting back your time spent on the platform. TRY spending time with your family and balance out your work life, cut back on the time spent on hits and try to workout what you need to do to get to a better place and pace working full time or part time, so you have time for yourself and for your family , online work is hard and you have to try and find that balance, like i did . put off work sometimes just to make yourself and your day better. sometimes you have to choose which is more important and figure it out from there. go with whats best for you and your health and for your family to get through the day and to get through life. its all about what makes you happy and how you can find that balance basically and who you can count on trying to make that balance for yourself and for your family and for work in your day to day life and working on mturk. maybe if its too draining try other jobs.

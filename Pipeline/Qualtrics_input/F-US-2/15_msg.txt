My best advice is for you to find a balance between working online and spending time with your family. Whether that be chores/duties, dinner, or just spending time watching TV or playing games, you can find a healthy balance. In my experience, I devote time, say a certain number of hours, solely for online work, and multitask while I complete the work. My free-time can then be used for family obligations. Communication is key for finding the perfect mix. Talk with your family or with your partner, find out what they want, and try to come to a compromise. In this day and age, it's common for boys/men to help out more with household chores and around the house. It is not your sole responsibility to take care of the house and/or family. Online work has helped me learn and master skills, and with time you will too. Do not be discouraged, focus on your strengths and weaknesses, and make sure to not forget about other things. For me, finding a balance between working and spending time with my significant other was definitely a process, but one that was invaluable to both of us. Now, we have a healthy relationship and I am progressing with my goals.

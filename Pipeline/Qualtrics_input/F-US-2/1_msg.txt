Equal treatment for men and women cannot be viewed from an individual standpoint, being mainly a social problem. Every social problem that affects both organizations and workers acquires a collective dimension. Indeed, even if reconciling work responsibilities with family obligations as a collective question is a particular issue, it should be granted further consideration in collective agreements – especially at plant level – since they are, as a rule, closer to social reality and social problems. An effective equal opportunities policy presupposes an integrated overall strategy allowing for better organization of working hours and greater flexibility. Flexibility should not be just for the benefit of employers. Modern workers have a need for flexible working arrangements and modern work organizations to facilitate reconciling work with family care, to allow time for education and to cater to their personal preferences and life styles. This is particularly true, indeed, it is essential, for workers involved in boundary less careers.

Family is clearly important.  It really is a huge thing that we have to balance into your lives.  I really feel that people sometimes get caught up into working too much and they forget that their obligations are also to their family.  You really need to assess your relationships with them, and think about the value that you can provide in order to determine if you should be reassessing the amount of time that you need to spend with your family.  I feel that if you can see that their emotional selves are less than optimal, you really need to see if you can take some time off of Mturk.  On the flip side, we all need money.  Maybe some of your relationship needs are not up to speed due to not having enough money after all.  then you might want to spend some time earning more money in order to pay those bills.  then your relationship with your family might actually be better since the money stress would be off of your chest.  i feel that you really need to do this quite often.  maybe every week or so would be good to figure out what you need to spend more time on.

I think when working online it's important to separate your work from your family. I will suggest you that set a specific time for working and give rest of your time to your family. Don't ever take a second away from your family time unless you get a very high paying hit on mturk. It's also important that at the time of work, you give all your attention to work and don't get distracted from other stuff unless they too are big. Have separate work hours. Now finding those fix work hours can be a issue because the nature of this job is very unpredictable but you need to observe the time when you can get most of good hits and make that time your work time. For example, in my case the best work comes from 6PM IST to 12 PM IST, so most of the time I don't even look for work during rest of the and I'm doing my own stuff then. 

Mturk can be tough to figure out so I would also suggest looking for some articles on how to make most money from mturk like using scripts and softwares, so that you can make more money during work time and then can give all your full attention to your family.

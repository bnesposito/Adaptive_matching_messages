It is hard sometimes but important to remember that the most important job a parent has is being a parent. Sure, making money to support your family is part of that job, but raising a child that feels secure and wanted is more important that that. After all, they are your legacy, your making, and should be your life - especially in the formidable years when they are under your (our) care. I have found that having set time periods where the kiddo knows to expect to be on their own for an hour or two sets parameters that they understand and can expect. Expectations are important for children - they need to know how their day will go, and is expected to go, to thrive and be amicable. I have set up reading time, chore time, play time (non-electronic), and electronic time throughout the day. In addition, I have hour long blocks that I spend time with them peppered throughout the day. This shows that you want to be with them and that it is important to you to be with them. It also gives them something to look forward to. It can be hard to break a day up, as far as work goes, but it is imperative to the child. That is the most important job of the day!

I have found that is important to maintain a regular and scheduled day even though you are working from home. I get up at the same time every morning and I get showered and dressed as if I am going to leave the house. I know what time I am breaking for lunch and I take that break. I have a dedicated space for my home office and that space is off limits to anything that would not ordinary enter my work space during a regular working day. I also have my set break times and make sure that I take those breaks. Sometimes we think that as we work from home we do not need those breaks but we really do. When the working day is done I will leave that working space. It is important to not let your work from home time become your home time. This is a serious job that requires separate and equally serious consideration. When the day is over, go and change into comfy jam jams and do as you would if you had just gotten home from work. Enjoy the lack of commuting and being home but never ever treat it like you are home.

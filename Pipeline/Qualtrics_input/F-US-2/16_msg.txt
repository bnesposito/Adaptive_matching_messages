Make sure that you get enough money to pay for your bills first that way you can get the main obligation for your household. Also if you know that there are times when your family is there, then try to work around it to take care of the obligations. If you can set your own hours at work, it would be better and probably help out everyone in the long run. You can also try to work with more than one company especially if one pays more than the other one. You want to make sure to get your priorities done, but you can't leave your family out and pay no attention to them. There are more survey sites that you might feel comfortable doing, or even with transcription that pays more money and you can do it any time that you want with companies, even stay up later while everyone is in bed to be able to get the money that you need to come into the household. It might take some time to get everything going right, but it will work out in the long run if you put the time and effort into it and you work when the work is coming in more.

Sometimes, it is hard reconciling online work with family obligations.  I think some people are under the impression that because one works at home, one can just stop anytime to attend to another's needs.  We who do this type of work know that is not the case.  You have to work when it's available.  

I have had times when a family member needed my assistance (or, more often, simply wanted it).  If it was a real emergency, I would stop working as I didn't know what else to do.  While I was sort of annoyed that I was inconvenienced through lost pay, I usually did what I felt was needed.  Other times, I would be more straightforward with the person.  I would simply tell them I had to work and didn't want to abandon that work for something trivial.  The family member got peeved a few times, but I didn't feel guilty.  She didn't understand the situation fully.  

So, my advice is to stand up for yourself.  You need to make money sometimes and can't drop everything at the drop of a hat.  I ask the person to put themselves in my shoes.  While they may not understand completely, I don't let it bother me and neither should you.

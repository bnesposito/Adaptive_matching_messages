I think it is a world wide problem or to say struggle that is faced by women throughout the years. But now it is changing because of the awareness and the awakening process that is spread wide along the world. At my yearly stages my mom used to work a lot in order to keep our family well feed and live. My dad went away after my birth but my mother never moved on. She accepted that situation as a challenge and lived all these years and struggled to grow us and now we brother and sisters are taking good care of her. I used to ask to my mom that why area you always working isn't that pain. She replied "I am not doing this because of no other way, i am doing this because i love to do for you and our family". That is where my life changed and i started to look the lives in different way. I go for work and my husband too. We shared our home works a half. One day he looks after laundry and next day i will. and that is not mandatory. If some one feels not good other will take care of that. So everything is about mutual sharing and understanding.

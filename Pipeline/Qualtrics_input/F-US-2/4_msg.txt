Well if your big issue is reconciling online work and family AND you're working on mTurk, you've got some big advantages going for you. One you really do get to set your own schedule. Work when your family is busy, it might seem like common sense but sometimes having a "routine" means that you tend to ignore the moments that you could spend with other people. Maybe work more mornings, or evenings. Is family always preoccupied on Sundays with other obligations? Then Sunday is a work day and you can take your Thursday off for family game night or something of the sort. Secondly, if you're working on mTurk, maybe you're in a position financially where you can take more time off. If the money isn't needed(I know mine is so I empathize) just try to focus on it less. Time is a fleeting resource and you should cherish the people around you while you have the chance. This might seem like a worry if you're doing mTurk as a primary income source, but realize your family understands that you're putting the time in to keep them afloat. Lastly since you're home and are doing piecemeal work, take more breaks. Spend time with them in those little moments. Have lunch with them. The tiny things help a lot.

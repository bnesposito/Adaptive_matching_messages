I have found that trying to balance online work with family obligations can be somewhat difficult. From personal experience, I failed to accomplish this properly due to fact that I spent way too much time performing online work tasks and totally ignored my family responsibilities. 
My advice is to make sure you take the time to attend to the needs of your loved ones. Do not shut them out and ignore them. Be responsible, caring, and attentive to your family. Make sure you listen to them, really hear what they are telling you. My failures in this area has caused tremendous hurt and disappointment in my personal relationships.
Due to these failures, I have learned that maintaining a healthy balance between online work and family obligation is very well possible and can be accomplished with the right mix of time management and understanding the true needs of your family. Make sure you are there for them when you are needed. Take the time to participate in family obligations and duties. Take the time to do fun and exciting things with your family. Taking the time to spend with family is one the most important things one can do, make sure you take advantage of it now or it will be gone before you know it.

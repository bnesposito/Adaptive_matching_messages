Hey there, 

I just want to say, first and foremost, you are not alone right now. With a huge global pandemic upon us, millions of parents are finding themselves working at home with children all around them. I understand that sometimes, there can be a little pressure coming from different forces. People expect you to be a good caretaker, a hard worker, a healthy person, a family person, a successful person, and after not so long, it starts to feel like too much pressure for one person to carry. 

In terms of actually managing through this situation, I think I've had a little bit off success here. First, I like to set very clear boundaries, when I can. Work time vs family time. It's very easy to let them start to merge, and then you're not really giving either thing all of your attention at any given time. Set times to work, and then plan when family members will need to be taken care of around your major scheduling concerns. 

Beyond that, I think it's super important to manage your queue. mTurk is nice because it allows you to work when you feel like it. I find that the best time to work is during the early afternoon, so I typically plan my day around my most profitable hours. Weekends are a joke on mTurk, not worth working, so definitely take that time with your family. Work on the HITs that are going to expire quickly first, and make sure to use tools like Turkerview to figure out which HITs are actually worth doing. If you're only going to be making $5/hour, you might as well spend your time with your family. 

Overall, I understand that it can be hard. Just remember that you're not alone in this.

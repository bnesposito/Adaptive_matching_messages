In my experience working from home and the balance of family life is very difficult. My house is really small, so everyone tends to be in the same area even if I'm working. The lack of space quickly became an issue, but this was reconciled through turning a bedroom into an office and making it off limits in three hour chunks of time. It was an adjustment at first, but as the weeks went on it became easier for others to obey the privacy for an office. Whenever the time restrictions aren't followed it is important to discipline as to not set a precedent of it being okay to barge into the office space at any time. I am able to get two 15 minute breaks as well as a 30 minute time for lunch so during those spaces of time I am able to do some household chores and tend to whatever is needed of me. Also, I have found it easy to implement small contests to keep those around me entertained without them needing to be around me. I've assigned cleaning tasks to others to try to lighten the load of me being at home as well where I include an incentive of some type.

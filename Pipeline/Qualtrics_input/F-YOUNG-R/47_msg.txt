To keep a good work-life balance, my best advice is to create a schedule and stick to it. It's surprisingly easy to blend work and family obligations when working from home, as you're not physically moving from home to the workplace and vice versa. It's important to make sure to completely stop working once you've clocked out or finished for the day, and although it's tempting to read work-related emails or texts if you receive them only minutes after clocking out, it's best to turn off work notifications once you're done for the day. After work, you have time to fully concentrate on your family obligations.

If your work does not have dedicated clocking in/out procedures and you must be on call, I suggest making a list of family/home obligations and assigning estimated completion times for each task. When on call and there's downtime, only work on one task from the list, and don't try to rush to complete the task.

If you live with a significant other, it's helpful to keep each other accountable in balancing your own work/life. If one of you notices the other is swamped with online work and is getting stressed out, suggest taking a quick break to distance yourself from the chaos.

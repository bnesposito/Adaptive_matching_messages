Lately I've been in a position where I'm currently learning and putting into practice reconciling online work with family obligations.  Part of my own obligations include things like tidying up the house, doing laundry, watching my baby nephew while my sister is at work, and occasionally cooking meals.  I absolutely love jobs like mTurk because I can not only have the online work, but I can do it at my own pace.  However, I still find setting apart a day-to-day schedule helps a lot in balancing work and home duties.  Plan for an average time you want to wake up every morning.  When will you eat breakfast?  When will you take your first break, and for how long?  Make sure to schedule some time for household cleaning as well.  On days where I'm cooking or watching my nephew, I likewise schedule my online work around my family obligations (e.g., start cooking dinner at 3:30pm, nephew takes a nap at 11am, etc).  In my particular case, since I'm watching my nephew for my sister, I'm also being paid as a FFN provider during that time, so I'm not losing as much potential money I would have had from work.  One thing I've also noticed is that there are certain times of day where more HITs tend to be uploaded.  Keeping that in mind and scheduling your non time committed duties (such as sweeping the floor) before or after those HIT blocks also gives you the most money for your time.  Above all, remember the importance of your partner, spouse, children, and/or pets and their needs, and be aware if some sites that you work on will allow you to take an emergency break (Here on mTurk, you have the option to return a HIT for example, while some HITs give you more than enough time to complete their HIT.  Some sites will allow you to pause a recording, or give you a date deadline rather than a timed one.).  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and hope that this helps some!

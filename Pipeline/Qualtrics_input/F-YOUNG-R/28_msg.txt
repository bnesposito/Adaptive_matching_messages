The best advice I can give you is that you have to keep a balance between the work and your family obligations. In my mind, I always put family first. Having said that, it is very hard not to put a lot of time into doing the MTurk work to pay bills and the basics such as food, transportation cost and just life. I will say that the longer you work on the MTurk platform the easier it is to make more money with less effort. When I first started, I took any and every job I could get. You need to learn how to choose and pick your best paying per hour jobs. Sometimes you can't go with the ratings you read about the requester. Sometimes you can make more money doing $.05 batch work than taking on a $10 survey that takes you 90 minutes. It is really about pacing. Remember to take breaks through the day and don't sit in front of the computer 12 hours a day waiting for the next big hit. When there is down time, do little $.25 surveys because those add up in a big way. Learn the tools that people have created to make catching HITS while you are working. Most of all, take care of yourself as this is a tough job, but it does get easier with time.

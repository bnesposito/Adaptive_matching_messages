Working online helps balance your day,  You can attend an online meeting while a load of laundry is going.  The point is, you can be more present in your family's lives.  Not only are you saving the eight hours traditionally spent in the office.  You are also saving commute time.  One of the huge benefits of working online is it's flexibility.  It allows you time in your day to go pick up a sick child at school.  Your office is open 24 hours a day so you can make up the time after the kids are in bed if you need to.  You can stop work to have a family dinner that you prepared earlier in the crock pot.  If you're behind, pick up later when all is quiet.  Many employers are flexible for this as they have families as well.  Yes, there are some who expect you to be seated at your computer for at least eight hours per day, depending on your job.  Be sure to have the requirements understood before you begin work for that company.  Also be prepared for the occasional technical difficulty.  It's somewhat unavoidable.  But be sure to set up a comfortable environment where you can concentrate and enjoy your work and your family.

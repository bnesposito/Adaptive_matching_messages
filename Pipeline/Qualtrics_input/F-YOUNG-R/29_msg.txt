When trying to reconcile online work with family obligations, it is important to set boundaries. Create a schedule. Let everyone know what the rules and scheduling are. Structure is everything! Although you have the flexibility to both at once, you won't be as productive without establishing the proper borders. So, do your work within a certain time frame. Make yourself an office space. Having a quiet, comfortable space to work in can make all the difference! Decorate it to your liking. Make sure you feel relaxed. Tell your family they can interrupt only if it is very important. Allow yourself small breaks every now and then. This is a good way to start your plan for working at home. Having no structure will result in feeling to relaxed and falling off of your responsibilities, possibly in both areas even. Try to get up and start your work at the same time every single day. This is important. If your family sees that you respect your routine, they will too. All of these things will help you get into the frame of mind that you are at work, and you need to be productive and get things done. I hope this helps!

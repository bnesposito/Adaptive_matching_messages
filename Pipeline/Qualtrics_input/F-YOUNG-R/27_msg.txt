While working online from home has its pros and cons, one can truly find that the pros far outweigh the cons.  I have found that by working online I have become far more productive, both at work and at home.  I am able to spend less time commuting which, over the course of a week, adds up to several hours.  That is found time!!  You can use that time to perform many tasks to prepare for your day, both work and home related.  Your family will appreciate you being around the house.  Just having your presence home makes all family members feel good.  Once you can establish off limit work spaces and work hours that your family knows must be respected, you will find yourself more relaxed and, typically, more productive.  Working online also provides you the opportunity to stay focused without the interruptions of coworkers.   It is surprising how much time is wasted at work due to constant stimuli pulling you away from the task at hand.  I recommend that you maintain a regular schedule that everyone in your household and your workplace can respect and deal with. Now, it's time to relax, focus and get to work!  Grab that cup of coffee and smile!

In my past, I have had conflicts with my wife over work obligations which had given a front-focus than my family obligations. With time, I learnt to reconcile my online working with family obligations and ensured that both obligations got optimum attention from me. To start with, I started by setting my priorities. My family is my priority and my work is also my priority since it gives me my wages. I learnt to schedule my work so as it would not collide with family time. Second, I began to plan and do my online work duties in advance so as they could not consume all my time leaving me with little to attend my family. Third, I started to limit my after-work activities and actually started to spend more time with my family after I had finished my work duties. Especially, during the weekends, I would schedule myself and devote myself to my family. In fact, up to date, I spent half of the weekend with my family on short vacations. At least, this has greatly helped in avoiding complaints of my absence from my family. Lastly, it would be advisable to have an on-time schedule that will always keep you on line so as to avoid work duties from clashing with family obligations.

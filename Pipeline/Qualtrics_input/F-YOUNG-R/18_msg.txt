I have no real family obligations myself, but I can imagine that it would be a big hassle and a chore in itself. It may be wise to have a predictable time for everything. Maybe put weekends in a category of itself and call that time off or whatever. Actually online working is sort of a blessing for those who can actually pull it off. You don't have to risk your neck commuting to a "job" every day. And you have much more time with your kids. You don't have to hire day care. So, consider yourself fortunate to be able to "work" this way. 
              It seems to me that setting a limit to your time of work is a responsible way to go.  Your work times should be consistent and predictable (not to be repetitive). I find that getting up really early -like around 530 am gets me started on the day on a good clip. I sometimes make more progress before 10:00 am than the rest of the day and afternoon all tolled. 
             The Mturk income is really not all that great, but, again, the upside is that you're not wasting time and money on commuting and all the other time wasters.

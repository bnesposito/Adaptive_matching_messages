It is important to reconciling online work with family obligations. While work is important it should not get in the way of family obligations. It is important to set limits on the time spent on work. This requires delicate negotiation with supervisors. Take the time to communicate with your supervisor. Make sure that your supervisor understands that you will not be available around the clock. This does not mean that you are a poor employee. It means that you will focus intensely on the work tasks during work time. You will then leave your work for family obligations. This should not result in a negative review by your supervisor. It is a reasonable request. Your supervisor should be understanding. It is unrealistic to expect employees to be always available. Employees have a life outside of work. This life includes family obligations. These obligations require time to focus on family. During these times the employee is not available for work activities. Work activities can wait until the next available time. Creating a balance between work and family will lead to a better employee. The employee can focus on work during work time while knowing that they will have time available to focus on family.

For me this is tough because my family is my world. I want to put them first, BUT we all need money to survive. I always strive to NOT put work before them. For me I prefer to get up before the family and WORK for an hour. WORK as swiftly and accurately as possible to maximize your earnings during that time. Now tend to your family. DON'T tell them or even allow yourself to think of your family as a distraction. I would now plant to spend the morning as a family - - doing the chores, reading books, laughing, go for a walk. Have a quiet activty the kids can do while you put in 30-45 minutes of WORK.  Prepare lunch and eat with the family. Make good conversation. Have everyone help clear the dishes from the table and wipe the table off. Can you now get crayons, markers, paper and a few other items out. You sit at the table and work on some of the penny HITS that don't take a lot of concentration. These HITS will raise your numbers quickly, but you can still take the time for chit chat while working. Everyone clears the table again and you take care of errands and/or naps depending on the needs of your family.

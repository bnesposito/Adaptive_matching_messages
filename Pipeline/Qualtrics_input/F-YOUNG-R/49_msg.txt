In working at home online and balancing family life, I have found you must be organized and create a schedule around your family. If you have kids to get ready to send off to school in the morning, that time would not be good for working online. I find it best to schedule in a calendar according to when the time to work is best. Find your own relaxing time so that you will not be stressed while you work and you can devote your full attention to your work and get the best work efficiency. While the rest of the family has their own things to do is the best time to get your quiet, productive time to work. When I work online, I tend to look at the work as a time to be involved in something that I not only need to have to produce money to live but to enjoy the fact that I can really be at home and have my job up and close. Thinking along the way that I don't have to go out into the weather when it is bad and into the traffic and I can wear what I am comfortable in gives me a good work ethic to commit to.

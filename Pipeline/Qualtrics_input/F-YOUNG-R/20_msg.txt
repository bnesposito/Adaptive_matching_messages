It's easy today to get caught up in work.  Even more so, we're stuck at home and the job responsibilities that we have at work are not running directly into what you have to do at home, with how you relate with your spouse, your kids, or any other relatives living with you.  Perhaps the best thing to do is have a conversation with those you love to see what they expect vs what the company demands and work out a compromise.
    A lot really depends on the time you are willing to put in when you aren't on the clock.  For instance, just a simple trip to the ice cream store in the middle of the summer with the kids could give them the time they want to have with you the most. You will have to talk directly with your boss as well and see what the company requires while you are at home.  They do need to realize that, although they have corporate or business responsibilities, they should not be making more claims on your time just because it appears you have more "free time" at home.  In a sense, youre still clocked in.  So make it a point to communicate with your supervisors and set a specific time when you are devoted to your job. No matter what, the key is communication and clear scheduling that everyone knows about and, for the most part, adheres to.

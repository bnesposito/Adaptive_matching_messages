I too work from home, as does my boyfriend. We don't have any children, aside from a fur-child, but I still think I can help since I have grown children and can therefore remember them being at home...

Since I'm able to create my own schedule, I always work during the day, when my other half is also working, and then we relax together in the evening. I imagine that if we/I had children, I would schedule myself frequent breaks so as to spend time with them. If they were very young, I may even try to work more when they're sleeping. If they were older and quiet wasn't a necessity for my job, I'd have the child(ren) in the room with me, perhaps with a child-friendly show on. During the commercials, I'd ask what happened during the previous block and ask if they had any thoughts on it or if they wanted to share anything about it, like what they liked best and worst and if they could think of a way to behave better than a character, et.

I would also make sure to make meals quality time, eating them and perhaps making them, if the child(ren) is old enough.

Insofar as my better half, when I take breaks, we get together if only for a few minutes, to hug and share a quick kiss.

If you're working online and having a hard time "reconciling" your work with your family obligations, then I would question whether you have the capacity to even hold a job.

Working online is probably the easiest, least stressful job on the planet. If you can't manage fixing breakfast for your kids or tying a shoe or changing a diaper in between staring at the blog you're supposed to review, or in between phone calls helping someone rest their password, then you should probably rethink your life.

I have a feeling that anyone who is "working online" is some entitled housewife who, while her husband is at a real job earning the actual family income, she's "working online" as an excuse to not clean the house or prepare meals. She can't make lunch for the kids to take to school because she's "busy with my online work".

I feel legitimately sorry for kids growing up in a house where one, or both, of their parents "work online" and can't manage to properly care for them to the point where they have to wander up to some stranger on the street and ask them for advice on how to reconcile online work with family obligations.

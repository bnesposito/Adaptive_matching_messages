You are wondering how to reconcile online work with family obligations? This may be hard in these troubling times but I can assure you it is possible. The change of many workplaces allowing coworkers to do their work online can be a good thing. But This online work can take up much of ones day, but since the work has transferred online we get a lot of time back. The problem is being able to manage the time between doing work and doing obligations of the family also. One must learn how to manage time like never before. And that managing must take into account what you value more, your online work or your family obligations. For instance, if your online work greatly benefits the family then obligations can be doing the online work. But, if the work is non beneficial, then changes may be made. The best thing one can do is find the perfect harmony of allocating ones time to the right things. Whether it be online work or family things. One shouldn't try to multitask the two. That would create problems within the two parties. So find the rhythm and the time to plan how you should approach balancing the two then all should come together.

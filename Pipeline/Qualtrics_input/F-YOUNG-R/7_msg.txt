I just want to say that you should focus on what is most important to you. It can be hard dealing with intersecting responsibilities but that is what is happening since you primarily work online when you are at home. I think you should block out times in your day to work and know that if you are more productive then, you can spend more time with your family later on.

Despite all of that, I consider my family to be priority number one. You should set yourself up to put them in the best position, and sometimes that requires sacrificing a little bit on the work side. A good company will support you in those roles and allow you the flexibility to attend to family matters as long as you work diligently in your capacity as an employee. 

Since I have worked at home, I consider my work to be of the same standard as it was when going into the office. I make money and I am actually able to spend more time with my family because I don't have to commute and can use that extra time to be with my kids. It is amazing the difference it can make and I'm glad I work for a company that helps me with these goals. Sometimes you need to work and that is OK, but the key is to have a healthy balance and realize that your family should come first.

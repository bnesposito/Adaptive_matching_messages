The first step is tp acknowledge is that it may be difficult but it is achievable. I too have faced the task of trying to strike a balance. My experience happened when i was on a family vacation and I decided to do online work while being there. My mother had spoken to my sister about how much time she was missing with me because of the time i spent on my laptop. After a little talk with my sister i spent sometime to reflect and look into my priorities. It turns out, family obligations comes first! Notwithstanding this, as young adults we do find ourselves in need of cash. So the best way to go about reconciling online work with family obligations, is to reflect, strike a balance and practice better time management. Dont wait until someone call's you out like i have. Because prevention is better than cure, and remember, family obligations should come first. So it really involves looking into your priorities and acting accordingly. We may mess up trying, but be consistent with your efforts and remain morally grounded. As said, it may be difficult but, it is possible. Also, practice makes perfect, so practice finding a way to create balance in your life.

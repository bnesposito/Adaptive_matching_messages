You still have time to work online and care for you family. The best advice I can offer is wake up early to get a start on working, the best jobs are in the morning! Even with taking a few breaks throughout the day to meet your family obligations you can still make a good additional income. Another thing that will help is using mturk suite. You will catch way more hits this way. Just staying organized helps too.Another thing I can recommend is looking on r/mturk for advice, or just other worker's experiences on the platform as well as your own. Another thing I can reccomend is trying to get the number of jobs done up, as well as watching out for low rated requesters. Looking at reviews helps a lot. The more you do on here the more jobs that will become available. Taking care of your family and working might not seem easy but you can do it! A routine and a schedule will help you stay focused and let you get  more done throughout the day. I can also say that preperparing meals might save you time during the day as well. Will give more time to work.

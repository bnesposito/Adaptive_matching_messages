In order to reconcile working online and family, I think its best to try to have times of the day set when you know you can be the most productive. For example, I know 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM and 1:30- 3:30 are the times when I'm most productive. In these time frames, I'm able to get a lot of my work done. This can help you by giving you opportunities and time to handle family obligations as they come up. It's not that you won't be working, you will just being getting more work done in time frames so that you can maybe take 10- 15 minutes to handle these obligations. This is one method that have worked for me. Another thing that I do that helps me to balance online working and family is planning out my work. At the start of each day, I try to realistically plan the work that I'll be able to get done. In most cases, I'm able to complete this work. One of the other methods that I try to do when needed is separating one from the other. When I'm handling really important work tasks, I try to really focus on these tasks. When focusing on family obligations that are really important, I try to maybe take off time if I can get it approved, handle the obligation, and then make up the time. I hope these suggestions help you work well online and manage your family obligations.

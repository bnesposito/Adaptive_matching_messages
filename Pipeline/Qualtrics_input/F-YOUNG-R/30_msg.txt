I had to work online and meet family obligations a while back due to the corona virus. a few takeaways that I gathered from it is always try to do your work as soon as you can. I was able to surprisingly knock out quite a bit of my daily tasks and customer needs by just doing them as soon as they came in. What I noticed is this also allowed me to take care of my two kids that were out of daycare(since they were closed) and focus on family time even during my work hours. One of the things I enjoyed most about online work was the ability to spend time with my family, so I was trying extra hard so anytime a remote opportunity comes up I would be in good standing with my company to take them up on it. I hope that these words can help you. Another thing that made it fun was I would schedule certain sections of my day to make sure my kids were getting enough attention. Another thing that helped if possible was I could always remote in and just work whenever, so if I had an immediate concern with my children I could clock out and help them. But I would just remote in when they were asleep later and finished up my online work.

Online work may seem perfect for someone that has heavy family obligations, but there are downsides to work that can be done from home. These include interruptions from other family members (especially children) and other household distractions. 
To successfully balance family obligations and online work I think it is essential to set aside time when you can concentrate on the work without distractions. If possible, you could even go outside the home to perform the work. Places like the library or a cafe are good places to go to get away from home distractions and interruptions. 
Leaving home to work may not be possible for people who are caregivers to children or others. In this case, setting rules and boundaries with the other members in your household can work. You can schedule blocks of time when you are not to be interrupted. Ideally you would have a separate room to do your work.
At the same time, you do not want to abandon your family obligations. It is important to communicate to other family members that the work you are doing is real work to support the family and you are doing it so you can be there for them.

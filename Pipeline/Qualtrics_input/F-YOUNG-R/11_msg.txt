There are actually many options for on-line work. I work for Amazon Mturk. It is definitely not a get rich quick scheme. But it is legitimate. You have to ask yourself how much time you want to spend at a relatively low paying job while at home. No commuting. No dress-up. Your own hours. Your own boss. I think that most workers use this as a fill-in between jobs just to get some pocket money. I am retired and do not need the money but I do like the idea that this money is mine just to play with. For me there is a psychological factor in that I analyze the HITs to determine what kind of requestor is offering the work. I am amazed at time how badly written the HITs are. You would think professionals would do at least a little proofreading prior to publishing these things. 
There are times when working on HITs becomes tedious. There is a lot of repetition to the work. Many times you wonder what the requestor really is looking for. You really could spend 30 minutes to earn $.20. Don't do that! I've earned $.50 answering one question. You will never know until the HIT is opened and the work started.

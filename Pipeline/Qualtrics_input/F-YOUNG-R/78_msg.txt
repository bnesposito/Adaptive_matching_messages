First of all, work is equally important to your family obligations because work is how you provide for your family. The balance between the two is very important, and is essential for success in both aspects of life. I actually think online work makes the work/family life balance a lot easier, if you happen to work from home that is. You can tend to your work duties while also taking care of your home life environment. This setup is very flexible, and easily adjustable. Poor time management can cause stress, anxiety, and not being able to care for personal issues, so it is essential that you're organized. Work is work and cannot blend into your personal life. Sleep is very important because without it, you cannot be successful. Getting started on your tasks early, so you have time to work is key. Balance is everything to this dynamic. Everyone has a different dynamic due to different factors like age, spouse, kids, and other responsibilities. Everyone's routine is different. Finding the perfect balance can take time. It's easy to neglect your own needs and health because of daily obligations. Having a good exercise,  diet, sleep routine is very important to your overall success.

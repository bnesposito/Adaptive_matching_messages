I would recommend setting strict boundaries and having a separation between your online work and family life. I have a set time that I have to be working, and a separate office with no distractions. This keeps me focused on my work when it's time to work, but also offers an easy way to escape work when I'm away. Also, you need to make it clear to your family that you value your time with them, but have other obligations to take your time as well. Lay out clear times that you can focus on the family obligations, and stick to it, so that they see you're true to your word. Don't be distracted by your online work when you're trying to take care of the family obligations. It will lead to a lot of stress and not being able to do either very well. You need to put your full concentration and attention onto each one at a time. Lastly, you aren't superhuman and can't do everything perfectly. Cut yourself some slack and aim to do the best that you can. But most importantly, be honest with yourself. If there's too much on your plate, see whether you can delegate some of your obligations to others in your family, or hire outside help to assist you. Don't kill yourself trying to do everything on your own.

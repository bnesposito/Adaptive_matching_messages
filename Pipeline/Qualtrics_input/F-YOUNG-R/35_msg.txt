First, online work allows a person a greater work flexibility compared to working in the office. With that fact in mind, reconciling online work with family obligations is in fact, a bit easier compared to working in a traditional office environment. However, working online (and I am assuming that by working online also means working from home) does have disadvantages regarding family obligations. The main disadvantage to working online from home is that family obligations can completely overwhelm your work. By completing consuming your time, family obligations can lower productivity. In turn, lower productivity lowers your income. In turn, a lower income makes providing for your family obligations more difficult because you are now forced to work many more hours. However, the flexibility inherent in working online from home is very important. Even if you need to work more hours in a day, you can work those hours at any time of the day (or night). So if you have to care for your young children for most of the daytime, you can spend your evening working while your children sleep. You also are able to mo nitro your children more easily while you are working online from home. Being able to watch your children lowers your stress from worrying about what your children are doing.

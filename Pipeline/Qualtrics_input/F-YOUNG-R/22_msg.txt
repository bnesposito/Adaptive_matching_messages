Just because your work is online, doesn't mean it should be treated differently than any other job you have to leave your house for. You have to make money and if it includes doing so from home, that is your job and you need to treat it professionally. Of course, family matters are important, but you have to take care of your work first so you can support them and yourself. The prompt for this passage I am typing is not very clear, but it sounds like there is some discrepancy with being able to fulfill family obligations and your online work possibly getting in the way. The way I see it, it is still work. You can not just not work and spend all your time with your family. There has to be a time for you to take care of your personal things such as bills and feeding yourself and your family. There should not be any issues with this, but some people do not see it that way. Work is important no matter what it is that you do. You have to make money in order to survive and however you do that is of nobody's concern but your own.

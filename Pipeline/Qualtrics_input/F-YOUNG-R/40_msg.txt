To reconcile online work with family obligations you would first have to find a site or place to do that. It could be google or excel spreadsheets or even word document.  You must first make an outline on whatever you are deciding to write about. It should start from point 1 to however points you nee to get across.  You can add points later on. If you are doing this outline, you may have to come back to point 1 and change it. You have to get down the most important items that you think are. You can change them throughout your summary. As you do this process, you will think of other items that seem important.  You can backtrack and decide one thing is more important than another.  That will always be an ongoing decision. People change their minds and decide to change their point of view.  It could take days to get the right points lined up, but the bottom line or outcome is the best. You need to be able to think outside the box. If you are open to new ideas, sometimes it makes it easier than the first ideas you come up with. Let your mind wander a little bit. Put down things that might sound ridiculous also. It might not be that far fetched in the long run.

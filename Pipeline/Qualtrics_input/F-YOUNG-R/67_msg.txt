My biggest piece of advice is to have a plan. I have a set amount I like to make each day along with a set amount of how many tasks I do. This allows me to have some control over what happens while staying flexible. I use a lot of tools such as Mturk suite which is very helpful for multi tasking as it is hard to stay on top of things sometimes. I have a full time job that mostly uses a computer, so online work is paired with my full time job. My goal is at least 10 dollars a day, and I think of it as making just over an extra dollar an hour for overtime. This way I do not let it interfere with my obligations when I am home. On days I get off early however I just talk to my partner about how much I have left and we normally spend time together watching something or playing on the couch while I keep it open and it gathers HITS. This way I can still multitask and my partner allows me to continue to work. I think the biggest thing is open communication and appropriate management of both time and family obligations.

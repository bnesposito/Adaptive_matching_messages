Hello. I hope you are doing well during these challenging times. The problem you face is a very real predicament faced by many people in today's society. It is a serious issue, with many people suffering mental health wise from the problems that arise from it. You have my greatest sympathy in dealing with your life circumstances. Although I am clearly not a trained professional in this field, I would like to offer you some advice as to how to go about recovering and moving forward from your issue. I know despite the pandemic, everyone still has very busy schedules, arising from familial obligations to, of course, work obligations. A few tried and true methods I have found are as follows. When facing a very important family event, for example, a wedding or funeral, those should always come first. However, with smaller gatherings, the priority is hard to distinguish. When my work conflicts with a family event, I bring my work to the event. You will still have time to chat and catch up with people, even if you are spending some of the time working. Save your menial tasks to complete during the events, while getting your more mentally demanding tasks done at home before you leave. This way, you can still be efficient, even when enjoying time with your family. I hope this helps! Best of luck to you!

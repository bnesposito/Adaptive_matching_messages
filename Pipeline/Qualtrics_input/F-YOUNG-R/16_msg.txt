The best way to accomplish it is to find balance, It is about separating the two so if you need to setup an office separate from your everyday life it would be great and have the safe space needed to function. Do not be shy in taking personal time when you need in order to take care of things at home but do not abuse it It is also about making sure that you are focused when need to be meaning just because you are home you have to be in the mind state that you are at work and be professional. Even though you are working virtually it is best to dress up and have coffee in the morning and act as though you were coming in to the office your office. It is beast to keep things simple and treat it as though you are working for yourself in order to get motivation. it will be much easier once you start taking it serious on both sides and also have a talk with family about how busy you are and how work is also important and you cannot come rushing to do things even though you are nearby

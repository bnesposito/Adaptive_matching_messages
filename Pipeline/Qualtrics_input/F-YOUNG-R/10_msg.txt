FIrst, please understand that LOTs of people stuggle with the issue, and in fact people have struggled with it for a long time. We all want to be good parents or caretakers of our family, whoever they may be. I think we often have unrealistic expectations of just how much can be done, or how perfect we have to be. Nobody's perfect, and probably few are are perfect and productive and loving to their family as you imagine them to be.

So give yourself a break.  Families, and especially young children, are very resilent. As long as your family knows you love them, then can forgive a lot. You would forgive them for mistakes, right?  So know that they will forgive you, and certainly don't expect you to be perfect. It's okay to tell them you wish you could do more, but there are only so many hours in a day, and we have only a limited amount of energy. 

If your boss has ever had such responsibilities, they may understand more than you imagine. They might have older parents they're concerned about. So be honest to both your boss and your family.  Honesty really is the best policy. Relax and know that the sun will rise tomorrow. The craziness of right now will pass, and we will eventually get back to normal.

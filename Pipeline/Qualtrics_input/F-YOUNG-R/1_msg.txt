Conducting work online is a great option for a person with family obligations. In many cases you are not tied to a set schedule as you would be with doing work in person, and that allows you more flexibility to accommodate family obligations. In my experiences doing online work, I would schedule my work hours to coordinate with my child's nap or independent play time when possible. And if there were any tasks that I didn't need zero distractions for (such as writing emails) I would be able to complete those while still interacting with my family. Online work has been very beneficial as far as allowing me to be with my family as I'm needed as opposed to being in an office all day. I feel like opportunity to do online work has provided me with more time to spend with my family and take care of the obligations that I have at home. The most important thing is to try to plan out your day in a way that works best for you so that you can complete your work tasks without compromising any obligations you have with your family. I think that online work can be very rewarding for those with family obligations to consider.

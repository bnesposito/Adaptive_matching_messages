Since the pandemic started, working in the office has been put on hold by so many companies. When my company switched to remote working I was so worried. How am I going to work with so many distractions such as kids and dogs around. I have come up with a routine. I start working online at 6am before many people in my household are awake. When my family arises, I take a break and make breakfast. I always take lunch around the same time. My family knows what time then to expect lunch. In the mid afternoon, I start cooking dinner. It works out because the dinner will be cooking while I am working online. Usually I try and finish my work by 5:30pm. Dinner will be ready and I can spend more time with the family. I have found this routine to be very helpful and less stressful on myself and family. If you create your own routine and stick to it, I believe you will be successful at working online. Once you get a handle on your routine, you can add some things in, such as taking a walk outside during your lunch break. I find the walk very relaxing.

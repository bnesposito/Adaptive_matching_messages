Reconciling online work with family obligations can be difficult and challenging.  You can be in a productive state of mind as you are working online, getting a lot done, when you are suddenly interrupted by a family matter, and have to stop working.  What I use to do, and many people have done, is to try to just deal with the interruptions as they happen, and hope the situation improves, but that usually is not the best way to handle it.  You have to do two things, every day.  First, you have to get into the habit of saying "No" when appropriate, rather than just automatically giving away your time and attention to whatever comes up.  Second, you have to establish some clear boundaries that clearly define when you are not to be interrupted, and not available.  I have needed to do both to deal with my elderly mother, who lives 10 minutes away, in the next town.  When she wants something, she gets nervous and anxious and impatient, until it's taken care of, regardless of the time of day.  For years I used to just stop whatever I was doing, to help her, which added a lot stress to my life.  It wasn't until I started saying "No", and set some limits as to when (and how often) I would help her, that the situation improved and became more manageable.

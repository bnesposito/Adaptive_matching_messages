Managing work online when you work from home while also dealing with familial obligations is something difficult to overcome. However I feel that within my experience I've done so, and admirably so; I would like to help you with doing so. In order to help solve this problem, I have made it very clear to my family what might work obligations are. In doing so my family has complete knowledge in what I do and when I need to be alone. 

Because my family is completely briefed on my work obligations, they understand that I cannot be bothered during certain times of the day. My family understands that this job is just like any other job and just because I am physically at home does not mean that I can be bothered as if I wasn't at work. I find that closing yourself off in a single room and having the door closed is a great way in order to inform others that you are not capable of being bothered at that given moment. As long as everybody has reasonable expectations as to your availability during the times in which you are completing online work, your family should have no problems with the short amount of time that you will be available to help with their needs whilst at work.

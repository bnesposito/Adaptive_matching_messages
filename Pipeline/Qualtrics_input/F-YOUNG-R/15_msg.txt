I understand that working online can require a great deal of focus and attention. Personally, I admit that I sometimes lose track of time when I am on the internet and keep finding new things to do. However, it is important to make sure that you do not get too pulled into what you are doing. You should be able to feel like you can take a step back and unplug when you need to. You should never become too attached to technology because it can distort your perception of what is real and what is just conceptual ideas. In today's world, it is more important than ever to be present and create meaningful relationships with real people rather than with people who you will never actually interact with in real life. It is important to stay connected with family outside of just the internet because family members are constants in your lives that will always be there for you even when you do not have an internet connection. We should redirection our attention and efforts toward our family members because those relationships will be more fulfilling and will give us purpose outside of just work. We need those relationships to ground us and bring us back down to earth.

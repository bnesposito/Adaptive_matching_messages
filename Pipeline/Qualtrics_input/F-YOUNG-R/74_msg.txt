Prioritizing tasks and obligations is the goal in reconciling online work with family obligations. When done correctly, in a perfect case scenarios, it will work out smoothly. However, it is known that not everything will go as planned. More often than ever, unexpected life events will happen or worst yet, get off the wrong track. In such cases, keeping an calm and clear mind is crucial. Dividing big tasks and conquering them piece by piece is useful and performing tasks at a pace can provide more accuracy over errors happening. Otherwise, things would get even messier when rushed with an impulse.

From my experience, this technique is dividing things up is very useful, especially from a time where I had to delegate tasks to a group of staffs and had to prevent them from stepping on each others' foot. Doing things at a pace gave me a clear mindset in the tasks needed to be performed and break them down into smaller pieces so that I can assign duties to staff. I find that in the end I can keep track of these duties assigned and put them back together to complete the bigger task as a whole effectively and accurately.

If i'm understanding the passage correctly, you're trying to work out and balance working online and obligations to your family. Working all in all is a big obligation for you family, you NEED money to provide for them. Working online is just one way of making said money, me and my wife are both Mturking right now, i have 3 kids with her its hard, while also being in online college. But we both bring in about 20-30$ a day so we make due. You just have to find the perfect balance between working online and spending time and doing things for you family. All in all though, your family obligations are probably more important, so fraction your time around how much you want your life to be remembered. We aren't immortal beings, we are human beings and we need to remember that we only live once (no offense if you believe in reincarnation) and to choose to live our lives how we want to. I love working from home though, i put educational shows on for the kids in the morning, and make them food. Following i work till i meet my goal, do lunch with them and then find time for school and out door activities.

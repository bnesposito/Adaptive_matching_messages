It can take some planning and effort, but balancing online work with family obligations can be done.  The first step is to record the time you work online for about a week.  Also, during the time, take notes of the types of things that are important to do with your family and ask them about what are the most important parts of the day for them to have your time and attention.  For instance, they may treasure a half hour in the morning to eat and talk with you before they start their day.  Also, they might value having dinner with you and spending the last hour of their day relaxing with you while watching TV.  I've found that planning the time for family first and then scheduling work around it to be the easiest and most effective method of balancing the two.  You'll also tend to feel more rewarded for your time spent on both because you and your family will be aware of the times you've specified for them specifically.  While you work, you won't feel guilty that you are neglecting your family.  You also will not feel rushed in your work, which will lead to greater satisfaction.  Believe it or not, using this method will make you feel more satisfied that you are spending enough time with your family, even if it's actually less time, because you are doing so based on their requests.

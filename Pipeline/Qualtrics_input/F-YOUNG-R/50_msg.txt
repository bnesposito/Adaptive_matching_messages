The most important thing to remember is that online work from home is still work.  Imagine that you have to get up, shower, get dressed and go to the office every day. You would have to take care of family obligations when you get home.  Working on line from home ought to be somewhat the same.  ?There is a real advantage because you can be somewhat flexible.  But you need a schedule so you can get your work done.
Figure out when your family needs your help least.  That may be early in the morning or in the evening.  With some luck, it could be midday.  Also figure out when your online work in the most demanding. Write  down these times for both schedules on columns. Find times where the obligations do not overlap. That is the beginning of a schedule for you. You need to sit down with your family and work on this schedule so that everyone understands that there are certain times of the day that you need to work and that, barring an emergency, the family needs to amuse themselves during these times.
The great thing about online work from home is that you can be flexible and you actually have more time  for work and for family obligstions.  You just need to stick to a basic schedule and have your family follow it also.

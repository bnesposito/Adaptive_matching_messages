when working online, it is important to reconcile the differences between working and home life.  you should remember to limit the amount of time you work online so that you can have time everyday to take care of your home life. It helps to set a schedule when you will be working online, maybe four hours in the morning then four hours to take care of your personal life and then come back and work 4 hours later in the day.
previously when I was working online I would work 12 to 16 hours a day and would end up completely worn out after a couple of days. Then I would have to take a couple of days off to rest up. Obviously this is not the best way to work online. The formula I gave you in the first paragraph is much better and will not wear you out as much when you are working online.

try to remember what's really important in your life.  sure it's nice to make money but you also have to take care of yourself everyday.  it is much too easy to overdo online work and end up totally exhausted.  

please think about what I've said and try to limit the amount of time you work online each day.  for me it is much better to just work for hours at a time and try not to overdo it.

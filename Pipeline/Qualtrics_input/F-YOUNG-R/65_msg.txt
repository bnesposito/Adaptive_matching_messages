So, I know that sometimes it is complicated to deal with the family and obligations when working at home, but this is nothing more than the organization. I'll tell you how I do it: I wake up early (before everyone) have a coffee and get ready to start my day, put a song on the headphones and start working. As I am alone I can do a large part of the tasks, and then I take small breaks during the day, whether for household chores or to clear my mind a little bit, I try to be isolated from the family while working and join them in these breaks, It is also good to do a little exercise in these breaks, even if it is for 5 minutes, just get up from the chair and start nothing difficult. I guarantee that this will help you a lot. Take time for yourself, eat well, talk to those you love. When you only live for work and only think about work you are overwhelmed and sad. You have to be fine for yourself and then be fine for work. Create goals, but don't be disappointed if you don't reach them, each day is a different day, today is not so good but tomorrow can be much better and can make up for that day. I hope these tips help you just as they help me every day, it makes my job much more profitable and stress-free. Good luck!

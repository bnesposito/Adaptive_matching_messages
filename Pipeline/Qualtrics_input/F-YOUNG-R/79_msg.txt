I believe the best way to reconcile your online work with family obligation is to make a set schedule and discipline to spend time with your family members and time you can carry out your work obligations. That way you can easily follow through what needs to be done in the day. There should be time for everything and when you are working online you should have minimal to no distraction from your family members and should try to simulate the experience similar to how you would normally work to have an optimal experience to get the job done. After you're done working online, you can use the remainder of that the time to spend with and fulfill your family obligations. It's understandable that when you're at home that family members can latch on to you and it can be difficult to accomplish your tasks that pertain to your work. You should address your members that at this certain time frame that you are working right now and it needs to take precedent at the moment. From my experience, the best time to work to accomplish work-related duties is in morning when the majority of the family members are asleep and there are minimal possible distractions.

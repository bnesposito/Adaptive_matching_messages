In this season, it has much harder to balance online work or working from home with my family obligations. The first rule that my wife and I have is that we both shut down our computer at 5:00 unless there is a very important task that is time sensitive and needs to be accomplished right away. Other than that, we always shut down on time to be able to transition to spending time together. After we turn off our work computers for the day, we usually go for a walk around our neighborhood together to hear about each other's day and any other topic we want to discuss. This allows us to spend uninterrupted time together where we can talk and transition from work into our family time together. For us, it always important to remember that family comes first, followed by work. Careers and jobs change throughout our lives, but we have made a commitment to each other that our family will last forever. This helps to remind me that family is my first priority and no job or career is worth taking away from that priority. We are also very intentional about scheduling plans and activities for the weekends where we spend time together as a family. We feel that if we don't make these plans that sometimes we will feel guilty about not doing anything and sometimes feel obligated to fill that time with work. Planning these family activities help us to ensure we are spending time together and not focusing on work.

Ok so working from home is one thing, but working from home if you have children is another deal entirely. Ok that being said it isn't Rocket science here. Whether you work outside the home or in it online or offline. A 40 hr week is the full time assumption. How I worked it out is  after having over 30 years of working full time out of the home , I quickly realized that it wasn't me that had to adapt as much as my family did. My work time is MY work time and MY WIFE AND KIDS MUST RESPECT THAT and go about their day like I wasn't home whatever that may be. I am self disciplined enough to keep myself focused , but others in the home need to have the attitude that you are NOT available for 8 hrs or more. Just like when I worked outside the home. This is the only way it works no matter how committed YOU are. The entire home has to be on board and respect the unavailabilty. Period!
If you are just dabbling in online or at home work , then that is an entirely different matter. All the above is for someone trying full time work online from home.

With this whole pandemic going on and the added pressures of transitioning into fully online-based work, it seems like the line between home and work gets blurred lately. I know it is very tough because it feels compelling to work longer hours since all your materials are a few steps away, and it is easy to login and just work. To add with this, family time has been pushed aside.

As a 20-something year old who is currently dealing with this same exact problem, I know it is very tough to separate it, but you should know that work will always pile up. Work is always going to have something to do even when you finish up all your projects/assignments. Family, on the other hand, is becoming a very rare obligations especially with the pandemic. Everyone is at risk, and we don't know when this will end. I would say enjoy the best you can (with social distancing rules) with friends and family because they can be the ones who will help through this tough times. Work will always be there.

Remember, you are working for the company, but they do not care about you in the long run. Your family, on the other hand, are always there for you no matter what.

In this current climate, working from home is a vital part of keeping society going. But working from home isn't easy for everyone. Some people have other obligations at home other than work, like kids, spouses, pets, and other family that require a lot of attention. But despite all of the distractions, work still needs to be done. My advice on balancing both things would be to create a schedule with your family, to make sure that everyone is getting time and attention. The family schedule could cover a day at a time, a week, a month, or whatever makes the most sense with your family. Every family member should have their own section of the schedule, so it makes it easier to see who has certain things schedules. Each family should discuss their schedules throughout the week, including work, school, and other important activities. Creating a family schedule will help to reconcile online work with family obligations, because everyone will get a clear picture of what needs to be done, and it also helps to schedule work around other family obligations. Overall, creating a family schedule will help you balance work, as well as things that need to get done at home.

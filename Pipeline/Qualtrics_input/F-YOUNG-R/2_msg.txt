I have found that the best way to reconcile online work and family obligations is to treat working online like you would a regular out of home job. If you freelance, set a dedicated work schedule to do work only and nothing else. Once you are finished working put it away and don't go back to it until the next scheduled time that you have set.

It helps to also set a schedule for family time or obligations. I think that prioritizing and being organized by using a schedule is a sucessful way to reconcile work and family obligations. This is the method that has worked best for me. 

When it's work time that is what you do, you work. When it is family time then that is what you do you spend time with family. 

People think that working online is a breeze but it takes a lot of self disipline and organization. I think it works best to have a dedicated room that you work in and when you're done for the day, you shut the door and walk away until the next day. It can be very challenging to work online at home but if done right it can be very rewarding.

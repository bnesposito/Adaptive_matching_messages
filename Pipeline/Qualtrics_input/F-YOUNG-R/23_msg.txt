You should always balance work and family. Family is hard to come by and you aren't able to get a new family. Work is also important but it is not as important as family. You should priotitize both as much as you can. Family is the base of everyones happiness and work is what drives you. In my own experience i have learned to take care of everyone who is around me. I spend my day at work and then my night with my family. It is a blessing to take care of everyone in my family. I want to work harder to provide for my family and theerefore that will make me happy. As a women,it is diffiucult because of the unequal participation. There is unequal pay and overall everything is unequal. I hope everything goes well and there and you just have to work through it to the best of your ability. I would say to continue to work hard and know the worth of your family. They will help you and support you no matter what. They will provide you with support, love and happiness. Evrything will be ok as long as you have family and thast all.

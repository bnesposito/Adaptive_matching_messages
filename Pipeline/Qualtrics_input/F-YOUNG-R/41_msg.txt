For my part, I think developing a routine is the most important thing to do.  By sticking to a routine, one can better separate work things from family things.  Otherwise, both responsibilities will bleed together and one will not be wholly focused on either.  Thus, a schedule should be made that  defines what one will be doing throughout the entire day and evening.   Specific rituals can help to manage the transition.  For example, one may want to get dressed up for work even though no one is leaving the house. 

 A key aspect to maintaining a routine is to not frequently take advantage of the flexibility that working at home allows.  While it might be great to spontaneously do an activity with one's child on a whim, this is a long term killer to maintaining boundaries between the two worlds.

One has to also communicate to co-workers and supervisors that you may not be available to respond immediately to emails as it may fall within your designated family time.

I wish I had more creative ideas for managing this conundrum, but it is really more a matter of the discipline of making a routine, communicating to all relevant parties and sticking to it as much as possible.



t be doing throughout the day.  Some have advised that one get dressed up for work just to create a work state of mind.

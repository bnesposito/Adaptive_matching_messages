I have spent some time working from home as an independent software developer, which was similar in some ways to working online for an employer, although there are some crucial differences. Nonetheless, my experience from that period was that it was very helpful to set very clear boundaries on what time was designated for work and what time was designated for family obligations and other non-work activities. For me, that meant creating and sticking tightly to a schedule of when I would work, so that I could focus on family once my working hours were over. When working online for someone else (i.e. your employer), it is likely that your job already requires you to follow a schedule of some sort, or at least are expected to work a certain number of hours every day. If your job does not give you such a schedule, you should consider asking your manager if such an arrangement would be possible.
Once you have a work schedule, you will be able to focus on work during specific times, leaving other designated times for family obligations. If your job cannot be performed on a fixed or at least predictable schedule, or your employer refuses to cooperate with such a request from you, then you may have a problem separating work and family life. If that happens and you cannot come up with any mitigating strategies for controlling your work life, then you may have to consider finding another job that fits your life better. I know that is not easy, especially not right now, but in some cases it may be worth considering if it can significantly improve your family life.

I am impressed that you are willing to think hard about doing a good job for your online work and for your family. Both are pretty important. I have been doing online work for a while, so maybe I can offer some ideas. However, you are the expert on your own family, so just take any ideas that seem helpful and ignore the rest, OK?

It helps to plan your online work for times that your family is less likely to need you. If you have small children, of course, their needs are less predictable. In that case, you can choose to do your online work when they are sleeping, or when someone else is watching them. With older children and/or your spouse, you can let them know you will be working, and check to see if they need anything before you start.

One of the advantages of online work is that it can be done on your own schedule. If an emergency need arises in your family, you can sign off of the MTurk survey, knowing you can work later. You can even plan your online work in the middle of the night, if you can manage to fit that in with your needed sleep.

I suggest thinking hard about how much you need the wages you earn from your work. That can be your guide for how much you need to fit the work around your family needs. More need could mean you would be willing to put up with greater inconvenience.

Like I said before, you are the expert on what your own family needs. Planning ahead should help your balance your work and family obligations. Best of luck!

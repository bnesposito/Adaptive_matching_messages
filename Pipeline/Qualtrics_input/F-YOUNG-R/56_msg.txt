The challenge of reconciling online work with obligations is real and worrisome. Most families are average size of a married couple and two children. The first and foremost challenge is sharing time with family and devoting quality time to good work online that is usually performed at home.
At home most families have a dedicated office space for the computer, internet hardware, and printer. However, the family will want to share this space and the computer and hardware.
This is the major problem. Time share must be scheduled in order for the quality work to be performed and family to have access to the computer.  If the work is not done, the job is not done, and the job may be lost with no income coming into the household.  Therefore, the family has to be told straight forward and must understand the importance of the online work is #1 priority.
Then the computer must monitored and limited use for security as the computer must not be harmed or broken.

Phone calls, emergency work requests, and etc. Therefore, a person must schedule as much as they can family time away from work.

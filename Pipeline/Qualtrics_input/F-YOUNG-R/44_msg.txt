I would say to set boundaries for yourself and your family. It's way too easy to blur home life and work life when you work from home, seeming like both are full time and neither is getting fully accomplished. With some effort, you can make work time from home and family time two distinct regions of your life. Set aside an office, a work station or room that is only used for work. Or even just wear a work "uniform", something that lets yourself and your family know that it's work time. When you are in that place, or wearing that clothing, you are at work. Certainly be available if there's an emergency, but set the ground rules that you aren't to be disturbed at work. You yourself will know that you are at work too. Don't do anything for home or family. Keep them separate. When work is over, leave the home office space or change from the uniform. And leave the work alone. Now you are on home time. It will take some discipline and practice, and habits for everyone involved, but it will be worth it to make work time and home time as two different things.

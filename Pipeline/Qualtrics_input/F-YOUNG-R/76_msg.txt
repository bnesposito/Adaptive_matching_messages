The best advice I can give for managing online work and home obligations is to simply work around your existing schedule as well as inform your immediate family members. It may seem difficult at first but you will become more comfortable with the idea as you get into your own working flow and become more efficient. In my experience letting your family know that your screen time is also your work time makes people more willing to lend a hand with other household obligations or at the very least less likely to disturb you for anything short of an emergency. Online work may not be the best paying gig there is but at least it is flexible enough to allow you to decide when you can work and when you would rather not or simply can not. 
Work of this nature is the true definition of a side hustle in the sense that it is what you make of it, it may help you pay that extra bill that creeped on you last minute or it can be "fun money" 
In my own experience most family members will be understanding and attempt to help out even more so if there is a small reward for their troubles. 
The best way to describe it to a family unit is simply a way to obtain slightly more breathing room for other obligations or to treat yourself and your helpers

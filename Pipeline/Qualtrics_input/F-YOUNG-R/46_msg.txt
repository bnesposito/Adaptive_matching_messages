I would advise you first to set a daily goal for yourself, both about how much online work you'd like to do and about how much time you'd like to spend on family obligations per day.  This will help you both to work enough to ensure you are meeting financial goals, but not overwork and forget about other aspects of your life.  I discovered the hard way that working online, it is easy to get sucked into completing surveys and earning small bits of money, and it can almost be addictive.  Some at some point during the day make sure to take a stretch break, take a walk, and make sure you are eating healthily too.  That will all help you to feel better about spending so much time staring at a screen.  Share any worries that you have about the difficulties in balancing this with your family too, since they will be in a better position than I am to tell you what they need and expect from you as you begin working online for longer periods of time.  Overall, I hope my message was helpful, you will do great as long as you set your mind to it!   Good luck!

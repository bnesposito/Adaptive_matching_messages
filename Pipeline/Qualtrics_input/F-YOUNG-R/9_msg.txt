I would let your family know that you will be more than happy to help them with anything that they need assistance with, but it must be a schedule that works for everyone involved. Let me know which dates and times work best for you, and use that as a starting point for negotiations. Let them know that you understand that there will be exceptions, and that schedule might have some flexibility to it in order to work for unforeseen circumstances, situations, or emergencies. Personally, I try to get my elderly mom to schedule their doctor appointments and procedures for my less busier days when I can afford to miss anywhere from a few hours to a half day. I also let her know that I need to be available to do my work on my busiest days in order to make money to pay my bills. I also try to have my mom schedule her doctor appointments and procedures for times earlier in the day, so that I can still have four to six hours a day to work once we get return home for the day. As long as everyone is open and honest with each other, and willing to be flexible, an agreed upon schedule shouldn't be too much of a problem.

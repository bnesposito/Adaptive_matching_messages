The best thing to do is evaluate your obligations and write down a timeline in which they need to be done. Then set aside a window, length of time based on what you can do consistently, and that window becomes your job. Online work is best treated as an actual job if you want to be successful at it. You need to remove distractions from your work area, turn off TV, cell phone, etc. so you can really focus. Let your family and friends know you are at work in this time frame and need to be left alone. Use a timer if you need one, so you can schedule in short breaks to refresh yourself.It is better to have a designated work area so there will be no clutter to be cleared away before you start working. Have all the tools you need at hand, pens, calculator, note pad, and the like should be nearby. I have found you have to devote yourself to a regular schedule and soon it will be automatic, so you can focus on the work at hand.Be kind to yourself and know that practice makes perfect, you can do this and be good at it.

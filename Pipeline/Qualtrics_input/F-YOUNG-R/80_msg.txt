Well working at home while having family obligations is pretty much the same as working on site somewhere else. The only difference between the two is that one is done at home where your family is present, and the other at the actual location. I would say that working online and at home is even better because your family gets to see you and you get to see them. But just like working on site, you get to have a schedule where you work your wor hours and then you have time for your actual family time. In my own experience, I am my own contractor. I have pretty much a work schedule but its for my work at home, and I explain to my own family that these hours are reserved for me and my work, and the payoff is that I get to take them out on nice trips, eat some meals that we want and other stuff. They understand that idea, especially my kids. A positive is also the fact that even when I'm working I get to physically see my partner and kids, and they get to see me. So being able to balance both family obligations and online work is totally do-able. You just have to find time to schedule everything out, so that both your employer is satisfied, as well as your own family.

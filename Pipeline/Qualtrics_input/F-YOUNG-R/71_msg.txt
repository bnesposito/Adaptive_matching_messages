I work long hours doing freelance work online, and because of the nature of the job I barely have any time for my family obligations. Sometimes, I barely have any time for my family obligations so over time I have had to learn new strategies to be able to reconcile my online work obligations with my family obligations. So what I have learned over my time of doing this job is to really understand how to manage my time effectively. I would also recommend writing out your priorities for the day and list out what is the most important tasks you should complete in the day. I would also recommend waking up early and getting into a good routine. It helps to have structure in your life because it helps you to prioritize more effectively. This is the start of reconciling online work with family obligations. Once you are able to get into the habit of waking up early, prioritizing your day, and setting a routine that works for you balancing the two obligations should become more easy for you to manage. If you can handle this for awhile , it will become like second nature to you. I hope this helps you!

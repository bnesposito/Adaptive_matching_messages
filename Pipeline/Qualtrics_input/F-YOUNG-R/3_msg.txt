This is my advice about reconciling online work with family obligations. To be completely honest, I have no idea what this hit is talking about, I just want the money. I don't have personal experiences, so I don't even know what to say about this. Right now, I'm at 49 words and I'm trying to think of what else I should say for this. I think I'm going to make something up, to be honest. When it comes to reconciling online work with family obligations, I believe it is best that you try to remain as sincere and genuine as possible. Why should you do that? I have no idea but based on my personal experiences, I have come to realize that honesty is the best policy in life. Now I'm at 132 words and I need to think of what else I'm going to say. Maybe I'll give an example of what I did to reconcile online work with family obligations. So, what I did to reconcile work with family obligations was, I just reconciled it, because I got it like that. You may not have it like that, but I do. I'm almost done with this thank god.

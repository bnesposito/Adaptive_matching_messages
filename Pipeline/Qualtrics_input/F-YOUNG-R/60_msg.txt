Before you start reconciling with your work with family obligations, you have to do some self evaluation. Self evaluation helps with finding out what are some things you did wrong and figuring out solutions that can help you to correct your mistakes. No one is not perfect and we all have some bad days from time to time. The most important thing is that it's never too late for improvement no matter what you may be going through with your life. 

It took me the longest time to accept myself that I am not always up to my game like I thought I was. I just need a few improvements to be better, then continue moving forward. I wish it was the easiest lesson, but it never is for many cases I should say. It is all about maintaining balance, communication, patience, and hard work. 
It is always an ongoing challenge every day and there is always a task that's going to test your willpower. At the end of the day, it is all about learning from experience and doing better next time, just everything else. I apologize if it's not enough to indicate to reconciling online work with your family obligations.

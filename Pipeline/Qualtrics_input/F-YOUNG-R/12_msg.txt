I have been working mTurk now for over a year and have gotten to the point where I make a relatively stable amount every week.  Recently I realized that I didn't want to be starting at the screen for hours every day.  It was more important that I spend time with my wife.  We are both busy during the day doing our own thing, but we are getting older now and our time is limited.  Some things are just more important in life than making money.  Just yesterday it seems like I was 30.  Life passes fast.  I think everyone should make time do other things, especially taking time for friends and family.  This year my Mom and my wife's Dad died.  I wish I could have spent more time with both of them.  Now that they are gone, I will never have that chance again.  If you have kids, they also grow up very quickly and before you know it they are gone off on their own.  And the more time spent working, the less time being spent with them.  Live your life, enjoy you time while you are young.  One of the worst things is growing old and realizing how much you missed. Don't let it get away from you.

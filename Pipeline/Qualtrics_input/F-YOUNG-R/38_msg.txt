It is difficult to work from home and keep your family happy at the same time.  When I first started working from home, I thought I would never get used to it.  It seemed as though there was no line drawn between the two.  It all overlapped.  This was not good for my family not was it good for my work.  I sat down with my family one evening and discussed the matter at hand.  I wanted input from everyone, not just from me.  Afterall, we are a family.  We all listened and at the end we came up with a schedule that we thought would work.  My online work hours would be from mid-morning to late afternoon.  Early morning would be family time before the kids went to school and hubby to work. Everyone pitched in to clear the kitchen and they were off.  I finish up some minor kitchen details.  I then have 30 minutes of "me time' with my coffee.  After that, I start my onine work without any interruptions.  I have about 5 hours for my work.  Then I start dinner for the family.  After we finish eating, we all again pitch in to clean up the kitchen.  Then the kids head upstairs for their homework and "their" time.  I have about 2 plus hours to wrap up my online work.  Then hubby and I go up to get the kids in bed.  
There will be times when something may interfere with the routine but if we all work together, we can get this done.  The important thing is to make sure you have your work hours separated from your family time.  You cannot be doing your work efficiently if you do not give it your full attention.  Make separate time for the family.  On weekends, it is time for a small celebration.  Go out for dinner, a movie, or treat the kids to McDonalds.   Do not ignore your family.  Make sure they understand that work is work, whether it is done at the office or at home.

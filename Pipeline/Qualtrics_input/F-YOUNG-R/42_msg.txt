First and most important, you need to decide on your time allocation throughout each day. It should consider both your work schedule and your family duties. Ask these questions before you decide:
1. When do I need to take my kids to school? Can my husband help with this and how many days a week?
2. Same questions regarding picking them up after school. Can you share this responsibility with any friends or neighbors who can reciprocate some days of the week or on alternative weeks?
3. What hours must I be online to interact with my co-workers?
4. Is my manager open to adjustments in my schedule dictated by fixed family obligations?
5. Can I split my workday into several shorter periods, say 6 am to 8 am, 9 am to 12 noon, and 3 pm to 7 pm?
6. Do I need to interact with co-workers in different time zones or even different parts of the world like Europe or Asia?
The overall schedule needs to balance your family and work obligations. It is also very important to leave some time for relaxation and fun. Set aside and block an hour for family dinner every day, say 7-8 pm. This hour everybody knows that you are NOT available for work meetings no matter what.
Also, block out some time to be alone with your husband. Both of you need time for intimacy and loving to preserve and grow your relationship.
Remember to enjoy both your work and your family!

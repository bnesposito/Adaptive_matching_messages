Balancing online work with family obligations can be both difficult and seemingly impossible. I am no expert in the matter, but I have found a few things that help me and make my life a bit easier. The first thing I can say is to set specific hours for work. If you have a  specific time that you do work related things, it will not bleed over into your time for other activities. For example, say you work from 9-5 and the time outside of those hours is for you, family, and whatever else needs to get done. The second thing I can recommend is having a dedicated work space, away from the stressors of daily life. Whether it be a desk in a room or a closet, one should have a space that they can go to work undisturbed and complete all of their tasks in a timely manner. The last thing I can think of is letting your family help you with work related tasks. Obviously, you work and not them, but there may be easy tasks or activities you can divide off that can help streamline our work and keep the family busy at the same time. That way, you can get done even earlier!

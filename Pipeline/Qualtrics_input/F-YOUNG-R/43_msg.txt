In order to successfully manage both your online work AND family obligations, it is important to try and set a fixed time when you will "Be at work". During this time, your family will come to understand that interruptions should be minimized. I suggest having a desk in another room (bedroom, den) that you can work from. You don't necessarily need to close the door, but it should be a separate space. This way you can clearly focus on your online work. There maybe other times when you can catch up on less intensive tasks... such as answering emails or managing your schedule, when you are in "shared space" with the family. In this mode, you can be with the family and respond to them as needed, but when the family is watching TV or just hanging out in the room together, you can tend to your work, always being ready to put it down if need be. There should also be time when you are strictly NOT at work. Put down the cell phone, put down the computer, and focus on what the family needs. It may be that you can also spend some more focused time on work after the kids have gone to bed... but don't forget your spouse (if you have one).

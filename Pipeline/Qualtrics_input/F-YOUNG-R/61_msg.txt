I think the most important thing to remember when reconciling online work with family obligations is to set specific boundaries. I'm not saying you should neglect the obligations of your family because you're on the job, but you should also not put off working just because something came up in the household. I know I've had issues come up where I would need to go watch something in the kitchen for example that would pull me away from my work. While this would be important, I would find it difficult to convince myself to sit back down and get back to work, which impeded my progress once my chore was finished. Thus, I think it's important to budget your time and plan very carefully. Of course, emergencies happen, however I would try to keep things contiguous, don't just interleave everything and expect to be efficient at everything. I try to schedule larger blocks for my work and use the breaks to get things done around the house. I think with proper time management you can find both success in running your home and in getting all your work done in a timely fashion. Who knows, you might even surprise your boss with how efficient you've been!

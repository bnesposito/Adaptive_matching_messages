I'm semi-retired, 70, and by myself in my living situation at present, but this is only a recent condition, and I have long experience juggling my work and significant other social responsibilities. Because of its nature, online work demands a degree of quiet and isolation. This is perhaps the most difficult aspect of it, but it needs enforcement if the work is to be successful (and frustration kept to a minimum). So how does one manage the two most important areas of ones life? Best practice, IMO, is to apply a firm schedule or structure to the balance between work and social responsibilities; a conscious application of time away from the work devoted to household relationships and other matters; deviation from this schedule *only* when the work or the relationship life of the home demand it (this last has to be a judgment call on the part of the worker). Since the time spent at work online (especially on Mechanical Turk) is flexible to some extent, time-outs in which social responsibilities and self-care can be attended to should be built into the day as a rule. This would be the case with a standard career offsite, the only difference being that the worker creates it himself--thus the schedule can be more flexible--rather than accepting an employer's structure. This schedule should be shared with everyone in the family who might have an interest in it, and everyone should give input to feel invested in the project. Positive family support of the online worker is crucial to success.

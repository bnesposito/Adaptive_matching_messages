I think that it is important to sometimes put family obligation first. Work will be there for the entirety of your lifespan, but family won't. Sometimes we can be a bit selfish and driven and just want to get ahead, but it's important to surround ourself with people who love us and aren't just also trying to get ahead. I know right now since you are young it may seen like making money and working might be the most important thing in the world, but honestly it just isn't. When we all get older, we won't be working anymore and then what do we really have. I would suggest taking time out of your day to spend time with family. Even if it's only for like an hour it's better than no time at all. You could even say that you are very low on money and because they're your family they might try to help you out. If not and you really need the money, you could take these surveys online while hanging out with your family. I do that all the time. I'll sit down with my family and split my attention between doing the surveys and spending time. I really think just being in the presence of people who love you will change your life.

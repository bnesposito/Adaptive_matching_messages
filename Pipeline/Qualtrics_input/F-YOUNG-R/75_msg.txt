I believe that the best way to reconcile online work when having to deal with family obligations is to have a plan and understand what works for you. Understand that there is not a one size fits all schedule and you are unique in your situation. Find a time everyday to block off to do online work that does not interfere with family obligations. This could be first thing in the morning before anyone else is awake, or during the afternoon when children are napping or even late at night once everyone else has gone to bed. Take the time to really think when the best time for you would be and block off that time everyday. Planning ahead of time will allow you to take the stress of trying to figure out everyday when you will fit in your online work and will eliminate decision fatigue. Another important factor to remember is to be kind to yourself throughout the process of reconciling online work. You will miss days of work and sometimes wont even feel like working at all due to family obligations and that's ok. The important thing to keep in mind is that  just getting back to reconciling online work is a success in itself and to keep working at it ever day.

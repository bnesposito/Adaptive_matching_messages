It is important to have a separate workspace where you can concentrate on work. Let your family know when you are busy and cannot be disturbed. You need to be able to concentrate on your work items so they need to understand they need to respect the times when you should not be disturbed or interrupted. Have a signal or sign so they know this, something like a closed door when you are really busy. At other times you can open the door so they understand the barriers in place, when the door is open they should be comfortable asking you a question or entering your workspace. You also need to understand their mindset, if they know you are in the house working online they will tend to think you are always available so be flexible to their needs as well. You may want to work your schedule so you have breaks through out the day which will allow you to tend to family needs, and give time to those obligations as well. The important thing is to find a workable balance between all of your responsibilities, both personal / family as well as what you need to do professionally.

In order to balance and reconcile online work with family obligations, it is important to have clear boundaries and a routine. Have a place where your work will be done, preferably in a place that is removed from the living space and can be closed off. Set boundaries with the family as it is important to not be interrupted when working. Set a routine. get up at the same time everyday. spend time with the family at breakfast and getting ready for their day. Make sure you shower and get dressed for "work."  Then at the prescribed time go to work. say goodbye and enter your work zone. After an hour or so take a quick break. Check on the family, use the restroom and then say goodbye again and go back to work. make sure that you take your lunch hour and spend it with the family. I spend about 10 mins eating and the rest of the time I spend with the family or getting some things done around the house. Each day I have a quick job that I do with the family at lunch time, like sweep the floor, clean surfaces in the bathroom, dust or on Fridays we go out side for a bit. Then go back to work. Make sure you leave work at the prescribed time and go back to the family. Get ready for the evening activities, like dinner, board game night. Just make sure you have a plan, a schedule, and a routine. This will assist you in your work from home success.

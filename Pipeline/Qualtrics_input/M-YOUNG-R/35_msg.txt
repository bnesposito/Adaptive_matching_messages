Hello fellow worker,

I am writing trying to help you reconcile online work with family obligations. Let me tell you, it will require effort and commitment!. It will be challenging many times, but not undoable. First of all, you need to set boundaries in terms of time for family and time for work, and not let them interfere with each other. It is importwnt that you have a private space for work, where family should not interrupt at all. It is also important not to stay working longer than needed, and attend family needs according to the schedule you have set. Please dress up for work, even if you are at home, because that will sign your family about the role you are playing when dressed up: a worker, who has to be as efficient and productive as if you were in your office or workplace. But when you are with your family, don't answer work e-mail, clls, or texts. Don't even go to your work area, to avoid discvtracting yourself, and steal time that belongs to you and your family alone.
Holidays and week-ends are not to work, and even if you have a due date, try to keep in mind that if you work well focused during work days you can still meet all due dates. Enjoy working from home, and be strong to resist temptation to procrastinate, watch t.v or sleep longer, just because you don't have to punch your card.

In my experience, the only one who can answer that question is yourself. For me, I know that when I have had to do this, the best way that I've resolved it is to sit down and write down my personal priorities and my work obligations, and also write down things that I want to do vs. the things that I need to do. I look at my calendar, and I look at things that may be coming up soon that I need to attend to. In this way, I can do some planning. I also look at people that can help me, and that I can call on for advice and assistance. This is an important step, because sometimes it's good to get out of your own head and get the perspective of other people, as well as see if other people can help with things, or if you can find ways of co-working or doubling up on repetitive tasks. In the end, you are the only one who can decide what is important to you, and what tasks are necessary and what are things that can be let go. However, doing some planning, getting out of your head, and working  with other people can help you to do this more effectively, and can help you find a good solution.

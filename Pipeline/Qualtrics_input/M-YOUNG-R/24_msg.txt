The Assembly deplores that the absence of measures aiming at reconciling work and family life primarily affects women, since they carry most of the responsibility for running the home, bringing up young children and looking after elderly dependents. The absence, inadequacy or inaccessibility of minding and support structures for children or old people obliges women with family responsibilities to work part-time or stop working altogether. Facilitating measures for reconciling work and family life is essential to enable women and men to achieve economic independence and take part in working, public and political life while also discharging their family obligations. These measures are a factor of growth and employment – particularly for women - and provide an answer to the challenges posed by population ageing. The Assembly should recommend that the Committee of Ministers assess the implementation of its Recommendation No. R(96)5 on reconciling work and family life. The Assembly should invite the Committee of Ministers to address a recommendation to the member States asking them to take the necessary measures to ensure, inter alia, equal wages for women and men, the setting up of accessible and flexible minding facilities for young children – in line with the European Union’s Lisbon strategy – and elderly dependants. Council of Europe member States should be invited, if they have not yet done so, to introduce paid maternity, paternity and parental leave and initiate dialogue with social partners, local and regional authorities and the private sector to help reconcile work and family life.

The most important advice I can give you is that you have sincere obligations to both your family and your job.  Morally, your family is an obligation you undertook voluntarily.  As such, you need to dedicate your heart and soul to maintaining your obligations freely and cheerfully.  Never short change your family.  Your family will be with you for the rest of your life - what time, effort, sweat and treasure you invest now will bring dividends for the rest of your life.  Additionally, your job is an obligation you have undertaken purposefully.  You investigated what talents and skills you had.  You searched for a position that could use your skills and talents and was willing to pay you for these skills and talents.  You are morally obligated to give your job your best effort to fulfill the requirements of that job.

 Online work now presents a potential conflict.  Being an online worker usually presupposes that you will be working from home.  You will need to in some way isolate your self from your family so that you can focus 100% on your online job with out distractions.  I am not suggesting that you lock your self away from your family, but you need to remember that you have pledged your employer about 1/3 of your life - be dedicated to that pledge.  I am not saying that you cannot interact with your family, but devote your upmost attention to work when you are working but also devote your full attention to your family when you are not working.  Spend quality time with your family but devote your full attention to your job when you are at work.

Remote or online working will present challenges, but you are capable of both being a productive worker and being a full member of your family.  Be outstanding at both.

You can reconcile online work with family obligations fairly easily. If your work is flexible it is even simpler, though it may take a little extra effort. If flexible than you can simply perform the family obligations first and then later in the day, or when not busy you can make time for your online work. If your online work is not flexible than it might be best to simply talk to your family about things you can do, perhaps schedule another date, find a better time, or simply just communicate openly about why you aren't able to fill the obligation. Most of the time people, especially family can understand that work comes first, as work is important to ones life and well-being. If they aren't accepting of the excuse than perhaps it would be better to simply do what you feel would be best. Don't stress over the situations at hand and try to just meet somewhere in the middle, if that isn't possible and the work or job is important than just continue it. Communication is key in any such situation though and needs to be carried out, regardless of the circumstance. Don't stress and just do your best.

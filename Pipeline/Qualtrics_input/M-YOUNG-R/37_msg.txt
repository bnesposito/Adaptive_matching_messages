Sometimes it can be hard to reconcile working online with family obligations. I know that I have struggled with this. One way to combat this is to set aside specific times where your family is already taken care of, maybe during their sleeping times or when they are doing another activity, and use those times for your online work. For example, if you have kids, work while they sleep. Either wake up earlier than them or stay up later than they do and set aside time for working. 
Another way is to use a lamp with two different colored bulbs. In this example, lets say one bulb is green and one is red. Explain that they can approach you for help or companionship when the green light is on but that they need to wait when the red bulb is on. That way they should not interrupt you when you are in the middle of something. If your family communicates via phone calls or video calls, let them know ahead of time when you are doing your online work and do not answer the call if it is during your work time.  You will need to set a firm schedule while also staying within the scope of what your family needs from you.

In order to balance online work and family obligations, it helps to have different priorities during different parts of the day. For example, if you work a 9-5, make getting your work done your top priority during that time. Except for emergencies and urgent matters, allow yourself the ability to work as if you were at a job that isn't at home, with no distractions. Then once work is over, shift your priority to your family and spending time with them. If you can, try not to focus too much on work and focus instead on your family and what they need. Also, utilize any days off to spend time with family.

 I am a college student living at home with my parents, and for something like online school, which can be done at any time of the day, it can be a little harder to manage my time. 11:59 pm deadlines make it tempting to do school work in the evenings rather than during the day. In order to battle this, I try my best to set a time limit for when I stop doing work. Usually for me it is around 8:00 pm, when my parents are also finished with their work. I set aside all of my textbooks and assignments and spend time with my family, trying not to think too much about school deadlines. If, for any reason, I desperately need to finish an assignment and must ignore my family obligations, I try to make it up to them another day.

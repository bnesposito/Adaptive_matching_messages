As an online worker you must be fair to both your family and your company.  Try to establish boundaries with your family when working.  I have an office in my home and the family knows that if the door is closed then they cannot disturb me.  However I do have flexibility that if they do need me and the door is open they are welcome to come in and talk for a few minutes.  But having that work space at home can sometimes lead to overworking or working late.  While there are times where that cannot be avoided.  But when you are done working, walk away from your office or shut that laptop for good and give your family their time with you.  Simply having dinner as a family or having a family game night, those times are important.  I am nearing the time in my life when my kids are grown and gone.  I wish that I could go back and spend even more time with them.  Have a few more family game nights or simply spending time at a park or going for a walk.  It is amazing how quickly the time will slip away.  You never realize when they are young that that they will grow up, but they do and it happens way too quickly.

Working online should be viewed as an opportunity not an ordeal. A person who is working online at home has the chance to spend more time with their family and still work and earn a paycheck. The main thing to establish at the beginning is certain rules about the separation of family time and work time even though all the time is spent at home. 
     Start with setting up a certain place to work online while in your home. Make sure everyone knows when at this place you are there to work and you are not playing or surfing the web. You are working and are not to be disturbed except for very important things or emergencies.
     Next, establish a schedule. The family is used to you going to work at certain times when working away from home. Make them aware that you will be working during certain specific time periods during the day and that when you are done working online things will be just like they are on a normal work day. This schedule can be posted for all to see or you can just make a sign that you hang on the door when working and take down when you are done for the day or taking a break.
     Setting up clear boundaries between working online time and family time will make everyone more comfortable and will allow you to meet your family obligations. It eliminates the misunderstandings that result from a lack of clarity.

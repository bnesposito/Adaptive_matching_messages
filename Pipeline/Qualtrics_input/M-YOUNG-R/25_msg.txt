So, amazon mechanical turk is a money making side hustle that you can use to make more than $100 a month. There are many tricks that you can use to make some money. I would say that the majority of the good paying hits come around 9 o clock. I once came across a survey that paid me about 50 dollars. That was the highest paying survey I have ever come across. It took me only 20 min too!! Some fun tips: Never do any survey that pays less the average wage per hour and takes more then 4 min, Don't do surveys in general that pay little and take more than an hour of work, A good requester is Noah Turk. I have made a lot of money by him. Some of his surveys don't work though. If you just registered, remember that more surveys come after you hit the 500 or 1000 survey mark. A few more tips, don't feel discouraged if you aren't getting a ton of money in the first few days, you aren't going to get that much at all during mturk. I have been doing Mturk for a year and only made 10000. So this should be a side hustle to your main job. Have fun,

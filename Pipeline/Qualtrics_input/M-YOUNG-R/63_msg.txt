You should be sure and create a schedule for when you are working online. Working online can be kind of freeform and you might spend too much time doing it and neglect other things in your life. It is much easier to become so wrapped up in work that you forget other more important tasks and obligations. You should remember that your home life is more important than your work life and it should be given a higher priority. If you create a schedule for working and keep to it you will have a way to organize the other things in your life you need to do. Use tools like reminders and schedules to tell you when you should wrap things up and spend time doing other things. I use a lot of tools on my computer to keep myself focused on work but when it is time to quit working I finish it up. I try not to forget about the real world when I am working online. Time can slip by if you are not paying attention. If you are organized you can get more done in less time and spend more time with your family and friends.

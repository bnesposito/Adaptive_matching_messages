It is quite a task to combine these two activities because when you are working from home there is something you family does not seem to understand about you cannot be available for them to help in any task specially if they can come out with a solution by themselves. So, there needs to be a talk between you and your family to specify certain criteria to be required if they absolutely need to ask you something or to help them so that way you will avoid any unnecesary fight or discussion and you can be paying your whole attention to your current task between your work hours. Also, you can stablish rules in order to determine priority between home tasks and work tasks because they need to be clear in order to both to function as they should and how you intent them to be. In short, I strongly suggest you to improve your communication skills which it is key in everything you do in life, and to nurture your job and family in their respective times. Do not take work outside your alloted time and enjoy the time you advocate to your family and then I assured your find joy in a balanced life.

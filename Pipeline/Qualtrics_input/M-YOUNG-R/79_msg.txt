Working from home while having family obligations can be very difficult however if you create a schedule and have a plan you can be successful at working from home. I would recommend that you find a nice quiet secluded area in your home or in an environment where you feel comfortable.and can get things done. From my personal experience working from home with family obligations at the beginning is really difficult especially if you have small children, however as time goes by you will start to adjust and become more comfortable in organizing your time. 

One of the things that I do to make sure that i meet my weekly work requirements is that i set daily tasks and goals. In between work i do recommend that you take a lunch break and several breaks in between. for example, if you work a nine to five job i recommend you set aside one hour of lunch and at least 15 minutes every hour to get a drink of water or to stretch your legs.

If you never worked from home asked your supervisor to give you weekly tasks for at least the first two weeks until you get the hang of working remotely. You can always research other tips to be a successful remote worker.

My advice would be to wake up early. I learned this from my personal experiences through life and when I wake up at 6:30 every morning I get more accomplished. And there will be days where you can wake up at 6:30 and do nothing but focus on your mental health. But even that is something positive to do that will start your day off on the right track. Now once you are finished with your work earlier now, you will have more time for family obligations. I'm only 26 years old so I don't really have many family obligations. I live by myself on the other side of the country from my family. The most we do is facetime a few days out of the week to stay connected. But all I know is that waking up early gives you more time at the end of the day to take care of everything you need. I use to wait until the night time to do all my work then I realized that only doing work at night takes away from me in two ways. First, I am more tired at night because I just worked and was active all day. And second, night time is when everyone else in your family is free too so that's when you probably want to be free also.

I consider online work to be a supplement to my income. I have a very modest pension and social security coming in, and my online work harvests maybe another twenty five percent on top of that. The end result is that I have to live very frugally. I can do that. I am an old widower, and live alone. I paid off my home a long time ago, and my expenses are comparatively low. My kids are all off on their own, so my family obligations are mainly communication over the phone and email. My garden supplements my food supply, and I don't eat out. My social life is comprised of visiting with people in the nearby town and on the beaches, and that is down to a bare minimum with the pandemic. Hard times!
Honestly, I do not know how people are making it now a days. We used to be able to get a job that covered our expenses and left some for saving for the future. It looks pretty tough out there to me these days. If you have kids and only one income coming in, I do not see much room for saving and investing in your future in today's economy. 
If you are single with no dependents, that is another story. Online work can support you if you work long hours and get efficient at it. But if you have a family to support, my hat is off to you. At least you can work at home and have some kind of balance in your family life. Cut expenses as much as you can and live frugally and you can feed the pack, but it won't be easy.

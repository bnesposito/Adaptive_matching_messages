I know it can sometimes be a challenging or daunting task to figure out how to keep up with and reconcile all of your work online while having familial obligations to fulfil. When I first made the switch, it was hard at first to find a way to stay self-motivation and without distractions, all while still fulfilling my familial duties. I've found that the best way to handle online work with family obligations is to sit yourself down and take a good look at everything you need to get done throughout the week. How much time do you need online every day? How much time do you need to complete family obligations? What times throughout they day do you usually complete those things? Try to take the time to create a schedule for yourself, even if you have to make it open-ended to have room to write-in (or out) new things on the list. Try to find a quiet space to get your work done, and relay what you need to your family. If they want you to continue to fulfil your obligations, they also have to try to be understanding of your needs as well, so that everyone is more considerate of each other and what you need. Once you have a firm understanding between yourself and family, and a schedule, try your best to stick with it, and make sure to leave plenty of time for relaxation!

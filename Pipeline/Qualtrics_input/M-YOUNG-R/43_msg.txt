At the beginning i though that it would be impossible to balance both. i found that the key is to set aside an area of your house that nobody can disturb you. Then, set aside your phone or anything that can distract you. Normally, i find that if you do it late at night or early in the morning it makes it easier to be less disturbed by your family. Because these normally take a short time you can also multi task and do both your work and family obligations if you can't find a time to do one or the other. i found that it is also just a mindset to get into that you know you have to finish work and take care of your family. So therefore when you start going about your day always have a positive attitude. Having a list in your head that you know what you have to do is also beneficial, mentally it helped me personally to stay on track throughout the day. One of the things i started doing recently is working in the morning while drinking or eating my breakfast. It allows me start the day productive and mentally it gives me strength to go on about my day.

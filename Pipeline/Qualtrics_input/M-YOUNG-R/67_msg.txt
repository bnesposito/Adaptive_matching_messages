Hi, I am writing to give some advice on reconciling online work with family obligations. Although I am still quite young and I don't have much experience, I hope my suggestions may be helpful for you. I think it is quite important to have an estimate of how much time you would spend on the online work and if you want a minimum interruption for certain online tasks. As you probably already experienced, some tasks take longer than they say, and some require lots of attention. Usually, when I have an estimate, I will tell my partner the time and environment I need, so that I can effectively finish my work. Additionally, I think communication between family members on how much time a day you will spend on online working is also quite important. Since for online work, there isn't a rigid working schedule, it is easy to overwork and forget family obligations. As online workers, we are more flexible with our time and we can definitely make the schedule ourselves. Some good times to work are when family members are sleeping, or when they go out, and you would know these occations better than me. Overall, I think communications between family members about when and how to fulfill the obligations are really important. Hope you find this advice helpful!

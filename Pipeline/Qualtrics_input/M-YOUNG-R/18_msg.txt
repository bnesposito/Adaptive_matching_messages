I would first tell the person to pray on the matter. As a believer in Christ, I think that should be the first step. I would also ask the person to give a little more information on the situation. What has been going on? what is your family feeling the issues are? Then, I would ask him to reflect on him or herself. What do you feel is happening? Are you having struggles with trying to balance the online work with the family obligations? If so, then I would ask the person to sit down with a pen and paper. They can write their day out. Try to get organized. If you get organized, then in return it may be easier to find that balance and be able to spend time with both situations as needed without neglecting one or the other. I would help the person with getting the organization under control. Once that is done, go to your family and show them or speak to them about what you have in mind. See if it would be something they agree would be helpful and more valuable to them. If so, then you just got yourself happy work and happy family!

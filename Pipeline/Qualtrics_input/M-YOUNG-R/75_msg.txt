Online work is important to your career and how you will advance throughout life. You should remember that while family is important, too, they often will not be much help in your career. Of course, it is necessary to spend time with your family or to not work so much, but maybe you can divide up your time to do a portion of your online work on a laptop while being with your family if it can be managed. In my past, I have found that working and spending time with family makes me feel less like I'm focusing too much on one or the other. While this may not always be possible, try to remind your family and yourself, how important the work you do may be beneficial to them in the future. If you have young children, they can also be great background noise to listen to as they play around you as you work. This work, whatever it may be, will help your earnings that will go to you having a better life, in any capacity. You should also remember to take breaks from your online work and during these breaks you can spend time with your family, even if it's a whole day away from the computer.

Combining work with family obligations can be tricky business. These days we are all being asked to do more and more in terms of our work obligations and the technology is there to keep us connected 24 hours a day. This can easily conflict with the time that we have traditionally spent with our families in a previously undisturbed way. It is important to draw a line between work and time that is to be spent outside work in a way that makes a solid delineation. One technique for doing this is to set aside space for work if you are working at home and only use that space for work. One can then officially start working when they enter the space and then move into family time when they leave the space. This is a good technique that anyone can use to help draw important distinctions between work and family time. In this way, when the two are initially separated it provides rest and relaxation away from work which in turn serves to further the goals of work by making us more prepared for work. The relationship between family time and work time then becomes a symbiotic relationship rather than an adversarial one.

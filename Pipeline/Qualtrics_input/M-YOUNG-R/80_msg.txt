Hello,

My advice to you is that it is important to have an even balance in life. With work becoming virtual, we must overcome some obstacles we have not yet encountered in life. One example of this being family obligations. When an issue like this arises I can say from past experience that it is okay to change your schedule. There are some things in life we cannot miss out on and it would be okay to change work. For example, a funeral, important birthday, or important family reunion. However, there are also situations that are not as serious and should not get in the way of work. When making these decisions it is important for us to realize how these decisions will later impact us. We should not just put off work because it is easier for us to do so. When these obstacles arise we must think of what is best for us overall. If that means we have to miss out on a family obligation, then that may be the case. It is always important to look at these issues from new perspectives to gain insight on what is most important to us and what will benefit us most in the long run of life.

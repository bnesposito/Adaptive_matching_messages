Online work and family obligations takes a give an take kind of approach. It is important that you have defined times that is given to family and defined times that are given to online work. It is important to decipher what the family obligations are. Having a timeline of the family obligation needs on paper can help you focus on when your online work can be done. So take a piece of paper and write out what the family obligations are during the day. Then take a piece of paper and write down what the online work obligations are. Then compare your list and see what is needed at what time. Once you have this you can see if there is compromise that can be done if there is a conflict on the two obligations.  You may find that you need to work more on family obligations in the afternoon than the morning so you could do your online obligations in the morning. I would meet with your family and let them know that as this may not always work but you have to set rules. But you also need to be flexible when an unexpected event happens.  This type of procedure can help you see exactly what needs to happen so your online work and family are harmonious.

You've a problem reconciling your online Turking, with family obligations? You've got an easy choice here: your family *always* comes first. We all only have *one* family but most of us have, or *can* have, more than one "employment," at least at one time. 

I assume that you're doing your Turking **from home**:L at least I hope so because that's much better than doing from an office. Working from home, in and of itself, can present a whole new set of problems but those can be worked out. It has both disadvantages and benefits but the benefits can be outstanding. For one thing, if you've got kids you can actually *experience* them growing up. Second, with the right attitude, you and your significant other can grow closer together, but you must remember that that has to be WORKED at.

In reality, you are in a very advantageous position, and lucky to be there, my friend. Work on finding and keeping the best possible frame of mind to make it work. Talk to the people who know you best, your close friends, and ask them to make suggestions on making it work. And remember that 90% of asking a question is LISTENING to the answer. 

You CAN do it, You CAN make it work. 

And remember to take frequent vacations. :)

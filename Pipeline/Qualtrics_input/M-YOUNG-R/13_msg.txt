Working online could come with its advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, you get to be at home and take the time you need to be with your family and get things done around the house. On the other hand, this could impact how efficiently you work. Other the past few months working online, I have developed a habit or strategy to my working schedule. I work 7 days a week and have a set goal depending on how much I am expecting to work and how much money I am expecting to make. I tend to work more on weekdays than on the weekends. Family obligations could definitely get in the way of work, especially of you are working online from home, but in these times of the pandemic it is a balance we are all still trying to figure out. What I do, is try to get at least some work done in the morning as an attempt to get a head start on the work day, then get lunch ready for the family. After that, I try to get as much work done as I can before it is dinner time. After dinner is when I spend most of my time with my family so I find it best to get my work done between lunch and dinner.

The most difficult thing you will find is that since you are working at home, your family will sometimes think you are readily available to them as you would be if you were not working. This will create a conflict because you obviously want to be a good partner / parent and want to come across as loving, but you also need to do what your company is paying you to do. Clear ground rules are the first step in helping alleviate this situation. Calmly let your family know that from such and such time to such and such time they need to imagine that you have left home for the office. If something important comes up they can text or email you, as they would if you really were in the office. This will make them really stop and think about whether it is important enough to interrupt you or not. Secondly, if at all possible work in another room in the house, preferably with a door that you can shut. Again, tell your family that if something comes up not to knock on the door but to text or email you instead. It's best if you can implement these things right away and not wait until you and your family have started bickering about things, as that may make them feel that they are being punished etc. But even in that case it is still important to be assertive and let them know what you need.

 I am a senior citizen with a considerable financial obligation, physically challenged and since the last twenty years I was self employed in the delivery /driving sector, I am trying to find a living in the online  world. It is possible to find a living.  But unless you get a job, you will be building up your clientele or work reputation. This takes time.  You have to be patient. In my case when I could sit at the computer again, I got in to mturk. First week  I made five dollars. Read a book in kindle, watched some you tube how to videos (with a grain of salt) and kept on working. After a month I am making an average of of one hundred dollars or more. I intend to make it lot more. It takes time and determination.  You will find something that will click for you. Search online for list/review of online jobs.  I hope you find your niche. Remember everything is possible and good luck.

The best advice I could offer would be to manage your time and ask for help from those around you. First have a family meeting; you may think you are spending too much time with work and not setting enough time aside for family obligations, but you could be wrong. Let everyone you think is effected by this, share their opinions with you so they can let you know if you are slacking anywhere in particular. Then, block off time for work, where there are no disturbances. I, too, work online and have set work hours. Because online work is sometimes more flexible, do work at peak hours. What I do allows me to work anytime of day, so every week I evaluate my obligations and fit work into areas of the day that work out for me. I find if I can focus just on work for a set time, I am better at letting the work day end when I need to. When you feel you have a plan that works, again, share it with the family. Really let them be heard and take into account how important some obligations are and how minor others are. Also, ask for their help if possible. If you have someone who can do a minor task that will allow you more time for other obligations, let them take a swing at it and give them thanks and appreciation in return. Working together can bring everyone to the same page and give them a sense of importance and responsibility. At the end of the day, family and work must be balanced to avoid burnout and stress. I hope these words find meaning in you and you reconcile in a way that benefits you and your family.

If you are able to do your online work at any time of the day, you should talk to your family and find out when they will be out of the house doing the things that they would normally do without you, and find out what times they would like you to be available to do things with them.  Then you can schedule your online work time around their schedules, and around the time they would like to have time with you.  If you can't arrange your own online work schedule, you should still talk to them, and let them know the times that you have to be doing your online work, and then you should still be able to work out some time for activities with your family that work for all of you.  Sometimes it might be difficult, but you can explain to them that your online work is important, and it is also one of your responsibilities.  If they are reasonable, I'm sure they will understand your situation, and try to work with you so that all parties can arrange a schedule that works out for everyone involved.  Both sides might have to be willing to give a little bit, but with a little effort, I'm sure you can work something out.

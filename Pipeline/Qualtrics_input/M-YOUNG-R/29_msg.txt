When you work from home you have to have a lot of discipline. It's easy to walk away from your work to do something else. When you don't have another person accountable for what you are doing its easy to fail. While working from home, set working hours as if you are going to an office. During downtime, you can do quick household chores or other things non-related to your work. Everyday, get up and go to your work area at the same time. Get ready for the day like you would if you were leaving the house. If you have family obligations mostly during the day, then work 2nd shift in your home. Set a schedule and follow it. It's so easy to get off task when at home. If you were in an office you wouldn't have the distractions like you do at home. Make a place in your home to work that is away from others. Make sure your family knows that you are working during these times. Stay close to your work area in order to complete tasks. Family time can come after your work time. Family is important but if you have a job you should set times for each.

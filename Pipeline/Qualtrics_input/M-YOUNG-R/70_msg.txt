I've been working from home for the past ten years. I would never go back to working in an office. If you are having trouble reconciling working remotely from home, consider that at least you are at home to handle things that may arise. Sure, you have to be disciplined and do what you need to do but consider that if you don't, it's back to the office you go. You go back to fighting with traffic on the way to work. You go back to dealing with inclement weather to and from, sometimes perhaps weather that denies you the opportunity to punch the clock and get some hours. You go back to having to pay huge gasoline or transportation bills to commute back and forth. You go back to paying more money at restaurants for lunch every day instead of making your own from cheaper stuff you buy at the grocery store. You go back to dealing with people at work that you may not enjoy. That's not to mention the time you waste sitting in the car, especially when the traffic is bad getting to and from work. Just thinking about all of this hassle makes me happy to be working from home.

It can be tough reconciling online work with family obligations. Due to the pandemic, a lot of people who usually worked in an office are now working from home and trying to deal with the disruptions and distractions that come with being in the household and with their partners and children. I think the best thing to do is try to set up an "office" in your home that is dedicated to work and only work. This means that family members would all know that the office is off-limits, and that even though you are home, you are still at work and are not to be disturbed until the end of the work day. 
I personally have worked from home since before the pandemic, so I am used to having to try to balance work with family obligations, and it hasn't always been easy. My family would ask me for favors throughout the day because they knew I was home. I had to gently remind them that while my location is at home, my mind is at work, and I must crack down and focus on my job responsibilities until the work day ends, other than the occasional midday break.

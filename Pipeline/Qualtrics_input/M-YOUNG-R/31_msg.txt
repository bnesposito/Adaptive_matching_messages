You need to find out where you agree on how it should be done and where you disagree.   Then you can really start to work on how to correct the disagreement.  I had this same issue with a former co-worker and we were able to work it out by each of us changing our viewpoint a little.   We did not argue, but tried to find common working grounds that each of us could relate to.   It was not easy and took some time but the end result was great.   We got the job done to both of our satisfaction and in a very short time period.   Sometimes family can be very difficult to work with, but you know each other well and should be able to reach a point of agreement.   Don't get angry....be calm....be reasonable....be willing to change your mind....they should be willing to also.   Do what is best for the family as a whole, not just what is best for you or the other family member.   I know it can be done as I did it and it brought the family closer than ever.   Good luck to you with this.   Stay calm and collected and you will be fine.

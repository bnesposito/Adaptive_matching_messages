Reconciliation is an accounting process that compares two sets of records to check that figures are correct and in agreement, now having to do this online requires so much attention and focus and also having family obligations can make it really tedious, my experience back in 2016 when I had to reconcile and manage family was when. I knew I could multitask well, I usually set time to my job very early in the day and I will promise my family that I will be with them shortly after I am done, although it is not easy to shuffle because of the total concentration needed, I usually lock myself up in the room and use my headphones, listening to Adele Album, which helps me with concentration and always in a dark room, all curtains closed and windows shut, I do not neglect family obligations, once I am done, most times drained, I rest for like 45minutes and set out to attend to whatever that is needed for me to do. This really helped me a lot and made me more diligent in carrying out both activities simultaneously, I really wish my personal example can help serve as a guide to you.

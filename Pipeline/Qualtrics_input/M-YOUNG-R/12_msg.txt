The most important thing to do is to pace yourself and your children. There are multiple teaching moments when you least expect it, so capitalize on them. Have a schedule. It will be your foundation. That said, be flexible. If all of you have more energy, then press on. If all or some of you are under the weather, then pull back. If you or your children are in a bad way mentally, always default to reading. Take turns if you have to. For work, have a schedule. Stick to it when possible. If you are a morning person, try to get up before the children and get some work done. Do the opposite if you are a night person. Make your kids best hours your absolute quiet time to hyperfocus on work. They may not interrupt during this period. All of you need to eat well. Keep fruit, cheese, and easy snack foods around for all of you. Buy more than you think you will need. Believe me, you will need more. All of you need exercise. Try doing something fun right in our outside of your own home, in which you guys are getting some cardio. Take time for yourself. Work out a way to have the children cared for at least one or two hours a day, if possible. Use that time to do what you need to do to feel healthy and autonomous. Good luck!

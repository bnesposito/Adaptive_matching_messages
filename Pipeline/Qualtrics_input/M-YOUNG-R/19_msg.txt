The best way to reconcile online work with family obligations is to set aside time to do both. It's best to set time for family time, and then set time for family time. Try to make sure you have time for both by setting up a schedule, and telling your family the schedule so they know when they can hang out with you and when not. I have done this by making sure that my child and husband know that from 7-11 PM at night I am unavailable. I am in work mode, and have to be working. But during the day from 9AM- 7PM I am available. I set aside that times so it's like I am working a regular job with regular hours, and to make sure that I am still getting time with my family. I think work-life balance is one of the most important things. So it's important to take that time separately. Now there is sometimes that during the day I do have to work. So what I will do is work for 30 minutes, and then have 30 minutes with family. I try to separate it so that I am taking care of both of my responsibilities. I think it's important to set those boundaries so we my family knows that I am not ignoring them, but need to have time for work also.

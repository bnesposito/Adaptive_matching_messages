When balancing your family obligations and home with life your work life when you have to work from home online, it's important to designate boundaries and hours specifically to your work. If you have an extra/spare room in your house, it would be a very smart idea to designate that room as your office and make it clear that people should only go in there for very important matters. Set a specific time frame that lets the family know that when you're in there, you're working and they should treat you as if you're at an actual office in a place of business. Something like 9-5 or so would make the most sense, but matching it to fit the actual hours you usually work fits as well. In fact, making it longer than the amount of time you work leaves you with leeway for "overtime" or such, so if you only work 5 hours a day making it an 8 hour "shift" works well. As long as you're in that room during work hours, the family should only bother you for emergencies. If you voluntarily leave the room, then they can talk to you and ask you things, so on and so forth. What you're doing is essentially emulating a normal work life and atmosphere to make the most logical and sensible (and reasonable) expectations for when you're working so that everyone knows how to behave.

If you don't have a spare room, you could make it your bedroom. Then your kids would treat it normally like an office, and any partner or spouse you share the room with you can arrange a situation so they can still enter but treat it like a work space.

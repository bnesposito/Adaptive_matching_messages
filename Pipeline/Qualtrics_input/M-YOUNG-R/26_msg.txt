Hi there – hope you are staying healthy during this nightmare. I am sure your work and family lives have been altered over the past few months during this pandemic. I know mine has! I am now working from home and rarely leave the house. Due to this, I have noticed that it is often hard to separate work and family, since they overlap and are occurring in the same spaces every day. The biggest thing I have learned is in order to separate the two, you need to set clear boundaries and share those with your colleagues and family. 

First, I would recommend having a dedicated workspace. Even if you don’t have an office, set aside one room for working and let everyone know that while you are in that space, you are focused on work. By setting up this workspace, it tells your mind that when you are there you are to focus on work, but also enables you to be kept alone from your family until you come out.

Additionally, try to keep as normal of a routine as possible. If you would normally get to the office around 8 and stay until 4, stay on that schedule. This keeps you from working too many hours and allows your family to know when they can see you and when you are working. Once your day is over, do not check emails or log back on, as tempting as it might be.

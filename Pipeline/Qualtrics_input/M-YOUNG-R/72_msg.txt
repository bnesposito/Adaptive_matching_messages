In my experience, reconciling online work with family obligations is difficult but far from impossible.  It is important for you to discuss matters with your family in an open exchange of ideas and information.  You need to impress on them the fact that you love and care for them.  One way that you show your love and care is to work to make money to support them.  They need to understand that online work is much the same as offline work.  Both types of work require your time and attention.  You need to be free to focus on your work in peace and quiet and without distraction.  Online work needs you to be able to devote set periods of time to it.  Just because you are home and a child wants your attention does not mean you can drop whatever you are working on to devote attention to that child.  You need to be treated with the same respect you would deserve and expect if you were working in an office or in the field.  You have to set boundaries and require your family to respect them.  Of course, you will drop what you are doing to as needed to attend to any emergencies or crises at home.

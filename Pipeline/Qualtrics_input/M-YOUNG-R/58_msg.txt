One of the challenges of working online from home if you have a family is the perception that members of your family might have that you are available to interact with them throughout the day even though you are working.  While probably not meaning to interfere in your work, the fact that you are at home may give them the perception that it is ok to just ask a quick question or to help them quickly with some problem that they may need help with.  While initially this may seem like a small thing, if you are living with multiple family members and they all have this same perception, your day can often be filled with many interruptions and distractions making it difficult to concentrate and focus on the work at hand.

My advice on how best to handle this if possible, would be to work in a separate room where you can have privacy from the rest of the family members and to politely yet firmly tell them that while you are in this room, you are not to be bothered with non-emergency issues.  Tell them that you will have scheduled breaks at certain times throughout the day and that if they need help with certain issues to wait for those break times rather than interrupt you while you are in the room working.

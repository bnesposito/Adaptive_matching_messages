It is never easy balancing online work and family, but it is one of the most important and rewarding experiences that a person can have. I know this for a fact because I am able to successfully get my online work done for my boss, while still making sure that all members of my family are able to talk to me or interact with me sufficiently during the course of a full workday. One of the most effective ways to balance online work and family is to set a schedule for yourself of when you start and stop working. This ensures that you will at least have a portion of the day dedicated solely to your personal life and family. It is also helpful to give yourself multiple breaks within your workday, as this allows you to not only rest your mind when needed but also be able to interact with your family if they need your help while you are working. Another good strategy is to limit how much you work. Talk to your company or boss if your family needs you more than usual. In this case, being open and letting your company know about your familyâ€™s need for you can allow them to reallocate your workload and take some weight off of your shoulders where necessary. I have personally done this when my children were ill at home and desperately needed me to be there for them. Companies are not as cold as they can appear to be and are often more than willing to make accommodations for you if you truly need them.

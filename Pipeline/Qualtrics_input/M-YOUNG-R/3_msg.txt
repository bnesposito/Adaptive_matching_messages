The first thing I would tell them is to communicate completely. It is likely that they feel some additional burden in large part because they are interacting with family and that is completely normal. However, they do need to make sure that the important information is going between both parties. Do not look at them as just another person because you will not be able to. This means that interact with them like family. Whatever the issue is make sure that you tell them the whole issue. I presume that his means that family obligation is the online work in question. If that is the case, try and enjoy the opportunity to work with your family. If the question is asking about actually reconciling online work then you must be forthright about the information that you will be needing in order to reconcile correctly. This means everything form bank statements to checks. In this instance it is better to know as little as possible as the money in question is not part of you. Meaning, that if you come across something that you think may be questionable do not question it as that is not what you were as to do for them.

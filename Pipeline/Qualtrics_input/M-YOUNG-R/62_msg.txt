My advice is to try to replicate the work environment at home as closely as you can to your normal workplace. This includes keeping boundaries, which is very important. In terms of physical boundaries, it helps to have a dedicated working space at home, even if this is just a designated table or tray. It should be someplace that you go to work. It should be a zone where others need to knock on a literal or figurative door to get your attention, so that you can do work without disruptions as much as possible. You should also set dedicated times to work. You should make sure to take ample breaks, especially if you are very sedentary or looking at a screen a lot; however, you should also have set times to accomplish tasks, mainly so that your work life and family life don't become indistinguishable. The key is to have times and a place for work, and times and a place for family. If your family impedes on your work time and space, your work will suffer. Similarly if your work impedes on your family time and space, your family and family life will suffer. When the two become indistinguishable, it can also be incredibly difficult emotionally and psychologically, because you can feel as though you're never able to turn off either; it feels like you're always pulled two ways at once, which can be exhausting.

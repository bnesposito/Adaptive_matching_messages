In life, a common theme people struggle with is trying to balance multiple obligations. It can often feel like you are being pulled in multiple directions at once. The key to success is to reframe your life in a way that your different obligations can be viewed as in harmony with one another, rather than in competition. When considering online work and family obligations, it can seem like there is not enough time in the day to accomplish goals related to both, and these two obligations are at odds. Alternatively, you can reframe how you view both so that the goals of both obligations align for one another. For example, view that your online work obligations are a necessary component of life to ensure your family is happy and healthy. Similarly, having a fulfilling family life makes it so that you have motivation and happiness that is essential to be productive at work. My best advice is for every obligation in one category, remind yourself how accomplishing that task will benefit the other. This will help to remind you of why it is important to accomplish your obligations. Finally, I would recommend taking one obligation on at a time, and not getting bogged down with the full gamut of all obligations that may lay ahead of you. Focus a whole heartedly on one job and attack it with vigor, then, upon completion, take pride in your success and acknowledge how completion helped you accomplish goals both with work and family.

I would advise that good organization and time management are the first steps to take in reconciling online work with family obligations. These are important factors in establishing the work-life balance. Other options could include considering daycare or adjusting working hours to fit around the schedule of your family. I think reliable affordable daycare is definitely necessary to optimize this balance. The affordability of the daycare can be a major barrier because if the costs are too high then the workload must also increase which will cause it to be difficult to reconcile online work with family obligations. It may also be possible to negotiate working hours with your employer depending on what your job is. The work-life balance is very important to establish because one can become burnt out and detached from their family if they do not have the time to spend with them due to long work hours. If there is no job flexibility it may be time to consider another job that does have flexibility, such as online work that doesn't have set hours as long as you complete the assigned task. All in all if you plan accordingly and are able to implement some of these, you may be able to achieve a work-life balance sooner.

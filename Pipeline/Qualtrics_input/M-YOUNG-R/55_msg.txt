The best way to reconcile online work with family obligations is to have a nice work life balance with clear boundaries. Online work is appealing because it can be done at any hour of the day, but making sure you are still committed to family obligations is important. This may mean making a schedule that mimics a normal work day so your hours align with your family obligations. In addition, this may also mean keeping odd hours if your family obligations are during the day. The most important thing is to not feel guilty about your work or your family obligations. It can seem overwhelming at first, but getting into a routine helps. Additionally, it is important to remember that although your online work may be non-traditional, your work is still valuable and you should never feel like your online work isn't important. Finally, I suggest making a list of your family obligations to give you a little inspiration you can look at while you are doing your online work. This will serve as a constant reminder of why you are doing your online work and why it is important to have the perfect online work and family obligation balance.

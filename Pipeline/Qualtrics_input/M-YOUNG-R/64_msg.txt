My advice on reconciling online work with family obligations would start by imploring one to lay down clear boundaries to your family. You must stress to your family members that if you do not make money, they will not have food clothes and shelter. So, just because "Daddy" is home, he is at work. Little Timmy sure wouldn't enjoy living out of the family car would he? Little Susie sure likes to wear nice clothing she buys online doesn't she? "Mommy" sure enjoys stuffing her face with tasty upscale pizza doesn't she? Once these boundaries have installed a sufficient amount of fear into the family unit move on to the next step: your family must pretend you are not at home during the day even if you are in the next room in front of a crappy laptop. Let call this step "Invisible Daddy". The rules to Invisible Daddy are simple: Daddy is at work therefore invisible. Daddy will rematerialize when his work is done. Kitchen on fire? Pick up the phone and call the fire department. Timmy is choking on a piece of chicken? Have Mommy give him the Heimlich. Working from home needs clear rules and boundaries from day one.

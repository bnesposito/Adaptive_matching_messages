In order to keep a good work and family balance while working online at home one needs to follow some important rules. You must have a dedicated space for your work where you can be alone and will not be disturbed. Make sure everyone knows that while you are in this space they are not to interrupt you unless it is an emergency. Set work hours that are very specific and follow them. Make sure you schedule in breaks in order to check in on the household. Do not get behind on work so you do not feel you need to take up what should be family time trying to catch up on work. Make sure after work and days off are devoted strictly to family time. Do any errands and chores during this time so you are not behind on those. Make sure to have a family outing once a week where you and your family can spend quality time together. These tips should help you balance work and family. You not get overwhelmed by either and spend quality time on both. Doing this allows you to be happy with your work at home online life. Hopefully, this has helped.

Reconciling online work with family obligations is has been very difficult personally. I find it hard to try to be able to focus on my work. Focusing on family takes away time from work and is a distraction sometimes. It causes me to be behind on my work. Sometimes you have to worry about yourself and get your work done than to focus on your family but not completely ignore them. You need a balance between the two. It is very difficult to balance between the two though. You just need to figure out the right amount for each. If your family do not support you then focus on yourself. Why should you try to help them when they never tried helping you. But if they do help you, then you should do in return. It can become a chore with family obligations. They can interfere with things that matter to you. Sometimes online work is more difficult, depending on the situation. Online work is not everything in life. Although not doing the work can ruin your future. It could be a waste of time and money if it costs something to participate in it. In conclusion, life is very hard.

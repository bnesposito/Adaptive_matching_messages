Managing family obligations is easier when working online because you set your own schedule.  When you have time available, you can work on tasks.  If you need to do something or an emergency occurs, you can usually just stop working on your tasks without very much punishment.  It may be difficult sometimes because you have to spend a lot of time working to make a good amount of money.  However, money is not the end all be all; if you need to spend more with family or there is a sudden spike in obligations, family is more important than any job.  There are also many other types of online work you can look into.  Many high paying online jobs require you to learn a new skill, but it is often very rewarding mentally and financially if you can pull it off.  One example of an online skill is video editing. There are helpful courses online that will teach you how to edit videos. There are also many forums and job boards that will help you find a gig.  Editing is also a growing field with many Youtubers and other new content producers requiring help in this area to do their job.

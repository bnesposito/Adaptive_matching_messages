It is hard to reconcile online work with family obligations. We have gone through a dramatic shift between our traditional roles to one that is completely online. From traveling and having a commute, to existing in a space where the lines between family obligations and work are blurred.

My best advice, based on my own experiences, is to make the line between work and home crystal clear. As much as possible, do not set up meetings or check email past the workday. Completely disconnect. That way, you can focus on your family obligations in the morning or the evening. It is also critical to have a part of your house dedicated for "work" for the same reasons. 

I would also advocate for creating a daily schedule with your spouse, if you have one, if children are involved. Perhaps your spouse can tell his/her work that they are available at certain hours for face to face meetings, while you are available at a different time so someone can watch the children if needed. I would also take advantage of keeping your video off and mic off when it is possible and perhaps use a bluetooth headset so you can walk around the house to go check something out when on a call.

Good luck and remember - you will come out of this stronger, much more connected with your family, and appreciative of how life used to be!

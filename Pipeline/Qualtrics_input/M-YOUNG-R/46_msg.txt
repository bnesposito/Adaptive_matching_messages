I can completely relate to this problem. I have been working from home even before COVID-19 to take care of my elderly mother. She does not understand how anyone can earn a living staying at home. She thinks my work must not be very important. I have tried for months to explain to her that in some ways working from home is harder than traditional 9 to 5 job. I have to fight for jobs, which are generally low-paying. There is often a time limit which produces stress. My mother would talk to me during these stressful times. I would respond in a loud voice to be quiet, and she would get upset. She says I am so mean. I ask her, would she bother me while I'm working in an office? No, she answers. I explain working at home is just like working in an office. I ask her to respect my work space and time. I know when I have to stop work to take her blood pressure and give her the medications. I know the chores I have to do because she can't do them. Just give me some room to arrange when I do them. Work is important. Money is important. Everything is secondary unless there is a major emergency. She still doesn't like it, but now she compromises, although reluctantly.

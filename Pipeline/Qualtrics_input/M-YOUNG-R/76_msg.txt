When online working, you should set clear boundaries for yourself, to ensure a great work life balance. With online working, it can be hard to switch off from work because it’s right there on your laptop, computer or cellphone. You should designate working hours during the day (e.g. 8 to 5) and only log in and complete your work as normal, but once it is beyond your designated time frame - you will log out, stop thinking about work and start spending time with family. This always allowed me to complete all the needed tasks and responsibilities at work, while having personal time to myself to spend with friends, family or alone. It also motivates me to work, because I know there’s an end time and I know I will get there. I would also turn off work notifications during this time as a pop up during family time in the evening can spur you to log back in, check the email and be sucked back into work when you shouldn’t be. You should work somewhere free of distractions and be fully present even at your new online office. Setting up your boundaries and sticking to them is the best way to reconcile.

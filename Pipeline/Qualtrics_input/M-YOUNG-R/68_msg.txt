I think you should first set your priorities - how much time do you want to spend working? How much time do you want to actively spend with your family? And then plan ahead. Get yourself a diary or write down in your google calendar, what goals would you like to achieve or manage each day, and which activities you would like to do with your family. 
Since you want to really invest some time in your family, you have to be also okay with changing up your routine because unexpected things might happen. Do not stress too much if something in your work will not end up as you have planned. If you are still able to meet the deadline, you are okay. Try to be accurate but focus also on building flexibility in your schedule.
It is also important not to forget to take breaks - from both, work and parenting. Allow yourself to have some pleasure, take an hour or two and visit the spa, meet with your friends, do some sport, or have a drink or two in the evening. It is important not to focus only on your work/family but also on your physical and mental well being. Good luck!

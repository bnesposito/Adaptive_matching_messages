In order to reconcile online work with family obligations, I sat down with my family and had a "meeting" with them. We each shared what our expectations would be for working online (i.e. noise level) and ways in which we hoped that the others could accommodate one another. We also shared our electronic calendars with one another so that we could better divide up tasks or chores for around the house evenly. This way, one person would not be stuck doing everything. We also agreed to give each other fair notice when there was a mandatory family event to attend to. By stating this expectation clearly, people could better schedule their work meetings around the family event. 

Initially, it was quite difficult to adjust to working from home. I was taking classes online for school and so was my sister. Meanwhile, my mother, a teacher, was teaching classes online and was quite loud when teaching. She also refused to work in her bedroom (where her desk was) so her voice was even louder because she was in public spaces and not behind a closed door. My sister and I grew frustrated that she had taken over the common space and that her voice carried so loud, so we all decided to compromise and we gave her own of our rooms to work in during the work day.

Online work can be rewarding, but it's primary benefit is flexibility. Flexibility, however, doesn't always perfectly fit with your family obligations. You will need to discover which times are most fruitful for your online work, and also do not infringe upon the times of your most reocurring family obligations. Think in terms of blocks of time; hours and days. Which times of day does your family most often require attention? Can you isolate those times to some degree? Does the availability of online work change during certain days or hours? Find a happy medium. Try to regiment them both, within reason. Neither, especially your family obligations, can be fully regimented, but taking a step in the right direction on an organizational level will aid your productivity and decrease your stress or disappointment when a conflict arises. Rather than try to think of this all at once, make a ledger of the times you work and how much output is reached. Then, make a ledger of the times when your family's pressing matters most often occur. You may be surprised to identify patterns that repeat themselves. After a few weeks, you can develop a schedule which yields greater harmony between work and family.

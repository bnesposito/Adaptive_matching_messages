Working from home seems like the easiest thing in the world but it's actually really difficult, especially if you're trying to juggle other obligations. Because you're home your family thinks you're free and available for anything; dinners, babysitting, chores. But a lot of times that simply isn't the case. Last week my brother asked me to come babysit his daughter in the middle of the workday. My girlfriend gave me some grief for not going to lunch with her. These are things I WANTED to do but simply couldn't because even though it doesn't appear like it when I'm at home with a laptop in front of the TV, but I actually am working. 

I think a good tip to handle this is to just talk to your family and make them understand your situation. Just because you're around doesn't mean you're available. Sure, there are times during a workday I can take it easy and give time to my family but when the work piles up they for the most part understand I can't be bothered. Setting boundaries like that is very important. After 5 pm I'm all yours, but before that I can't give you all of the attention that I normally would. It's important that your family understands that.

Obviously, work and income are important and should be priorities. But, family and friends are also important and need to be priorities. The advantage of online work is that, depending upon the situation, you may be able to have the best of both worlds. If your online work lets you be flexible about the time frame you have to complete it, you could get up and work early, spend some time having lunch with your family, get back to work for the afternoon, and then leave early to participate in a family activity. After you get home, you could finish your work. Also, if your employer allows, you could choose to work certain days of the week. For example, if your family needs a babysitter on Tuesdays and Thursdays, you could work during the weekend and take off on the necessary days. It would be more difficult if your employer required set hours of you (e.g. Monday to Friday, 9 to 5). In this case, you have to exert a lot of discipline to complete your work activities. It is very easy to become distracted by personal or family things when you are working from home. You have to be diligent about getting up, setting a schedule, and completing your work on time. Since you will save on commuting time, you can devote that saved time to your family.

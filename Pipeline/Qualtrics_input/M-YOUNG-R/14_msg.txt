I think this problem is something that nearly everyone experiences at some point. The key is to make sure you prioritize your family before work. Family is the most important thing in life and you should cherish every second you have with them because you never know when your time will be up. Of course you need a well paying job to support them and to sustain a lifestyle , but you should always make sure you make time for your family members above everything else. Your family will always be there for you and they will always support you no matter what and you cannot put a price tag on that. Therefore, my overall strategy would be to find a job that gives you flexibility or find a job that enables you to make a good enough income, but not interfere with your family life. If you end up working all the time , you will end up missing out on the most important thing in life which is your family. I would advise anybody to see happiness over trying to make the most money you possibly can. You need to be able to find the right balance and going all out for money will just end up leaving you sad and depressed after a while.

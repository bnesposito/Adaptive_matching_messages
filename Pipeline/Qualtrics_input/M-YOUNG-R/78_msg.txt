I'm not sure exactly what you're asking me about, or why you'd need to reconcile online work (is that working from home?) as opposed to work that's out of the house or offline... Since you can't elaborate for me, I'll do my best... 

If you live with other family members who are home at the same time, working from home can be an opportunity to spend more time with them. However, you have to make sure that others are clear on your boundaries and the fact that you do need to work at some point. Don't let them ask you to do chores all day long if you have an afternoon deadline on a work assignment, for example. 

Also be clear on how much noise you can tolerate. If you can work in a buzzing environment, that's great, but if not, make sure your family members know this so they keep it down. 

You'll also need to have discipline yourself. You can't blame your family members alone if you waste your entire day talking or watching TV with them and miss work you had to do. Be responsible. 

As a final note, if your family members are working from home as well, make sure you respect *their* boundaries as well.

The major thing about doing online work at home when you also have family obligations is sectioning off the time for each. For instance my family knows when I am working because the door to my home office is closed with a sign that says Mom at work. They know that when that door is closed and that sign is up that I am not available just as if I was not there but rather at the office. But on the flip side of that, I remain committed that when I leave that office for the day and flip my sign that says Mom is out I am done and DO NOT GO BACK to work for any reason. Sometimes I might split the day with 2 hours in the am and the two in the pm or whatever but the standing rule is office is work, out of office is not and the two lines do not cross. This way you are able to separate the office and home responsibilities. It takes discipline and dedication but the rewards of being able to see the excitement on my children's faces when I say.. "OK... I am done for the day! Let's Play!"

I truly don't see a reason for reconciling online work with family obligations if, as I would assume, the work is done from home!  Really, just leave the room you are working in once in awhile to visit with your kids.  Movie night, walks before or after lunch, not spending all day locked away in front of your PC.  I can be difficult to tear yourself away sometimes as you can feel guilty that you may be missing a call from an important client or a Zoom meeting.
The importance of having a task/calendar manager cannot be overstated.  Franklin-Covey planners work well if you attend to them constantly, but, I find that the task manager on my Android phone is by far the simplest, easily managed task list and calendar setup you could get.  Franklin (I carried one for years, refilled it anually) was such a slogging pain in the ass.  Seemed you were supposed to not only take the classes, but attend to it all through the day....5 year plans seem to be a bit much for me when I just need to get things done during the day.  It (the Franklin-Covey planner) ended up being a glorified address book.

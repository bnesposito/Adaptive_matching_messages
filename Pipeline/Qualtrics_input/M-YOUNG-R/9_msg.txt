It can be difficult especially at. first to get your family used to the fact that you are working even though you are at home.  It was not an unusual sight for the family to see my sitting at the computer prior to joining MTurk but in those days I was playing a game or putting together a jigsaw puzzle and did not mind interruptions at all.  Now I am sometimes concentrating hard on imagining my self in a scenario or listening via headphones and while I don't look any different the situation is actually quite different.  I do not have children but I have two spoiled dogs who definitely think I will jump when they bark.  In my case I share a house with a friend who is also newly working at home while still employed at a "real job."  Between the two of us we have learned to preface any remarks with "Can you talk?"  A brief no or even a head shake means Hold That Thought!  Another thing that is helpful with MTurk is that the work by its nature involves a lot of breaks when you can perform other household duties.  Often there is just not another Hit out there that you can do and that is a good time to throw in another load of laundry or take the dogs for a walk.  So MTurk work is different and my message is embrace the differences and you can make it work!

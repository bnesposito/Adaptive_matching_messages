Ive noticed with the every changing work environment that many people are struggling with their different lives all coming together in there home at once. I understand completely not only how daunting it is, but also the new skills everyone needs to pick up to enjoy a good wokr/home balance with everything. While some jobs may have alot of extra room for you to interact with your family during the day while working, its still  best to have specific times blocked for just work and just family. That way you do not have work creeping into you family life, and also have a moment to focus on obligations that dont involve family. Currently I have a room that i ONLY enter while working, and its been known that no one else is to interfere with that rooms. It works most of the times and I found myself staying busy and not being overwhelmed at home. With mturk and related freelance sites with a work at your own pace, its very good to take breaks throughout the day to regain focus and see you family.  More radiational jobs tend to benefit more from structure, though this could all just depend on your work style and life style.

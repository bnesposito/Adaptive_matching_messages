I would say that the most important thing, which you no doubt already realize, is that the two must be kept separate.  That is, time must be set apart for one that must not be allowed to overlap with the other.  Easy, of course, when one must leave one's home to work, but when working at home this can be challenging.  My suggestion would be to sit down with your family, including your children, and take time to help them understand that you won't be available to them while working.  As charming as it might be to have your children interrupt your work, especially during an online meeting, it really does take time--more time than you actually have--to return your focus to your work.

Also, be sure to arrange your work area such that distractions of any kind are minimized.  Make it clear, to yourself and anyone who sees your workspace, that this space is, in fact, for work, and nothing else.  The space itself and how you arrange it will give your family important visual cues that you are "at work" and must not be disturbed.  Even better, try to make sure your space has a door that you can shut.  And don't forget the DO NOT DISTURB sign.

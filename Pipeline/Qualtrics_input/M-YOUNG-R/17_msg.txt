The main way to reconcile online work and family obligations is to separate the two as much as possible. That means that you have to set up times where you will focus on working, and times where you will focus on spending time with the family. Work hours could be normal business hours (weekdays from 9-5) or they could be unusual hours (weekend mornings from 9-12). Just make sure that whatever hours you choose work for you. Stick to the hours you choose to work, and do not work outside of these hours. Another thing you should do is have a dedicated place in your house where you work. The only thing you should do in that place is work. You should not eat, spend time with the family, or watch Netflix in that place. The place could be a room in your house, or even a section in your room. Just make sure that whatever room you choose is free of distraction. Do not do any work outside of that dedicated place. To summarize, separate your work and family life as much as possible. Have a dedicated time and place for work, and do not work outside of that time and place.

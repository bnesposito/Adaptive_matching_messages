Well young man, the first thing I would say to you is to remember that work a job is mostly  means to an end, and that your family should always come first. Too many people make their jobs their highest priority most of their adult lives and end up missing out on many wonderful experiences with their family. So, I would recommend that you remind your family regularly how much you love them and how you will always be there for them. Then I would recommend that you proceed to set some expectations and boundaries. You will probably want to set up a home office in its own room with a door you can close. You should then let your family know what hours you will be working daily and ask them to respect those hours so that you can get your work done as efficiently as possible. Explain to them (especially your children) that the more you are allowed to focus on your work, the quicker you will be done for the day, ans thus the quicker that you will be able to wrap your work up for the day and spend time with them. Either way make sure you have your priorities straight. The older you get, the more you will realize that life is short...you owe it to yourself and your family to make the most of it. I wish you well!

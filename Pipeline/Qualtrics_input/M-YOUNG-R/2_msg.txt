I have found that if you sit down with your family and discuss what is needed you will have a better outcome. You should discuss the pro and cons of working online and dealing with family obligations.  For instance make time for breaks to fulfill family things.  Explain a schedule. It will be tough but once it becomes a routine the family will understand.  Make a room your office and explain that it is off limits.Maybe have your office far away from activity that goes on in the house.  Like I said it will take time to get use to it.  Put a sign on your door telling family that you are working.  I rewarded my kids with something special like making cookies or doing art projects. Spending quality time with them is a plus. I also find me time when everyone is content because that gives me the patience for the next day. Also a good night's sleep.  So remember to discuss the pros and cons and make sure you get everyone's input so that you can work a schedule with out arguments or temper tantrums.  I wish you luck on your journey of working at home with a family.

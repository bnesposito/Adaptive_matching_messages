I think this is a very touchy and hard subject to deal with because people who do not do online work do not understand. The first thing you should do is make your family significant other/parents/children understand that this is a job and it should be treated as such. You should try to get them to understand that you are making money like any ordinary person that goes to their job does. They should leave you alone as much as possible until the job is done. UNLESS they are in dire need of your help or its a family emergency. 

It is very hard to do online work when people do not understand your plight to begin with. So step 1 is making them understand that youre working a job. Step 2 would then begin to try to explain to them that you should only be interrupted if they are in dire need of your help or family emergencies only. Step 3 I would say then you/they can understand your time frames you can help the members of your family and what times are most efficient for you to help them. Communication is key I believe that is the most effect ways to over come any problems.

I believe you should prioritize family obligations at a certain time  but at the same time priotizie work because you have to put bread on the table and support your family. So I would suggest to put up  a time table for the week when u can do whart what with your family m embers and put your work hours aside so u can work and make money, but usually MTURk is the most busiest is when its early noon till dinner time EST from my experience. but yeah set aside your schedule and split the time allotmetn seperately and tell your family members when ur work time is and only contact u if its super important and not to be afraid to reach out. But yes Ithats what the advide I would give. Mturk is really randon number generator. But usually I would say during the day is when its most busiest, but sometimes they have HIGH single paying hits late at night, but yes I would just eyeball that thing while spending time with family but that is my own opinion and take on the whole sitauton. I do think that spending time is important too not just for yoyu but for them as well

Balance is a function of your lifestyle and domestic responsibilities. Married not married, children in play, single parent all sorts of stuff. Jobs vary to in how forgiving of personal time and/or when they must be performed. So having a clear idea of how they interact is then sort of "overlaid"on goals and values. Do you value free time more than money, are you climbing a career ladder? In my country one just has to work. It tends to carry more weight. Often this is a hard calculus and may be one of the few times in life that major choices can make use of gut feelings as to satisfaction. Dissatisfaction likely means that one side of the balance is out of whack.
Remembering that this balance is always going to be in flux and it will gradually, inevitably need tweaking, is not in itself a cause for dismay. It is just a signal that one is not happy with the amount of time that work or life is getting. In this modern life we often here that "there just isn't enough tie to do everything". Surprise, that is absolutely right! This when prioritization is important. One doesn't have to do everything. We actually do a lot of things that are ultimately time wasters and are meaningless. Ridding clutter in activities is like cleaning the house. Everything gets more simple. How's that for off the cuff? Hope you like.

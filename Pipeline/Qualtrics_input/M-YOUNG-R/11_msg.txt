Well, taking into account that family time is paramount in being a good father one must balance work and family, having said that, it is just as important that a good father must do his best to provide for his family. I would suggest that you treat this way of working just as you would if you were working out of the home, making it clear that you have a set time to be uninterrupted. Also, making it clear that normal workday, breaks, i.e., lunch, personal breaks, etc. will be observed where you will be available for interaction. If possible prepare a quiet and solitary place where you can perform your duties without interruption of any kind. No through traffic, no TV's, no outdoor path, etc. It is helpful to rise at a certain time, work for specified times, and be sure to quit at a regular time. This routine will help the family to fall in line with the rules and habits that will make for a smooth working and family environment. If you remain diligent and consistent you will find others will respect your time and appreciate your dedication to family, as well as, dedication to your work. Stay strong!

Working online does take some time getting comfortable and used to. Family members may not understand initially how difficult but important the transition to online working is. They may view your working time as regular online relaxing sessions when that is not the case. In the past I have had to express that my time online is the same as their own work time. This meant creating a difference between my work space and home online space. My family learned the difference between these two spaces and understood that when I am working online to give my space. They treat it the same as if I was away from home while working and only get my attention for important issues. However this also meant I needed to continue looking out for their needs. If they ask for my attention during online work time I still will check in with them. Also, a major aspect of working online to make sure you have good time management skills. There must be times to take care of your family obligations after all work requirements are met. It will be difficult to ensure this since online work is almost always accessible, but it is incredibly important for it to not consume your life.

The first part of reconciling would be to set a standard routine first. You should wake up at the same time everyday and schedule out how you're going to handle your normal duties at home and then work around those. You should also make this routine very flexible because we all know that life can be chaotic sometimes. Also, since you're working at home on MTurk, you can always do work later. Don't be so hard on yourself if you waste your morning or afternoon dealing with a family problem because you can always put some hours in at night. A lot of times, you can find quite a few good HITs once most of the people in the country have gone to bed. Also along those lines, since most HITs allow a generous time to complete the work, don't be afraid to step away real quick and deal with your kids or talk to your family members if needed. You can always step away for a few minutes and deal with the more important things happening in your family's life. Basically, since MTurk is so flexible, just don't stress and know that you will always have some time later to work.

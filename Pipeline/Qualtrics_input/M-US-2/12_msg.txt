I HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME SITUATION BEFORE. WHILE I STARTED WORKING IN ONLINE MY FAMILY MEMBERS WERE AGAINST IT. AT FIRST THEY CANNOT ACCEPT IT. BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT I WAS JUST DOING SOMETHING USELESS IN HOME WHILE WASTING MY TIME. AFTER ONE MONTH I GET PAID AND THAT MADE THEM BELIEVE THAT I WAS NOT DOING SOMETHING USELESS BUT USEFUL.DURING THE INITIAL TIME ALL MY FAMILY MEMBERS USED TO TEASE ME LIKE I WAS AN INNOCENT FELLOW SOMEONE IS USING ME FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT. BUT I WAS STRONG IN MY OPINION AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM. SO WHEN YOU WANT TO SOMETHING FIRMLY DON'T HEAR THE OPINION OF OTHERS. IT IS SUITED FOR EITHER DOING RIGHT OR WRONG. IF YOU ARE DOING RIGHT THEN YOU WOULD GET SUCCESS WHILE YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG NO PROBLEM AT ALL YOU WILL GAIN EXPERIENCE FROM IT. EXPERIENCE IS THE MOST VALUABLE THING WHICH WAS NOT AVAILABLE DURING YOUR LEARNING TIME.SO BE FIRM IN YOUR DECISION. ONCE YOU CHANGE YOUR OPINION ABOUT OTHERS THEN YOU CAN BECOME A BETTER PERSON IN LIFE. CONVINCE YOUR FAMILY BY TELLING THEM TO TRUST YOU AND MAKE SURE THEM TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE NOT DOING WRONG.

It can be quite tough to manage working online with family obligations, but I have found it works well to have somewhat of a schedule. For example, if I know my husband is going to be getting up later, I will get up early in the morning and try to put in a few solid hours of online work before he gets up and responsibilities to family life begin. This allows me some time to focus on my work without interruptions. 

You can also try to set up some time in the middle of the day or the evening where it is accepted that you need to focus. I have found that sometimes this time needs to vary, depending on the day and what else needs to get done, but I have an understanding with my family that I need some alone time to focus on work and make money. If you make them aware of this time ahead of time, they have time to ask you for what they need first. It also draws a line of respect. 

Overall, I think you need to accept that working online while having a family comes with some risk of interruptions. It is best to just accept this will happen and try to get in a routine to minimize it.

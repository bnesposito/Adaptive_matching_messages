In order to reconcile online work with family obligations, it's best to treat it as if you were working in the office. Set designated hours to when you work and when you log off. Don't mix work and family life. Ensure you have a dedicated space for your work that is private and can be closed off from sound from the family and also that people cannot enter and exit freely. This will help with focus as well. Do not take your work outside the home. If you go on vacation, it may be tempting to take your laptop with you and log into work during your downtown time (hotel time) but this will affect your relationship with your family members and reduce everyone's enjoyment of the vacation. Make sure you're picking work that gives a decent hourly as it's easy to get sucked into doing a hit/job and not realize that the pay is inappropriate for the task length and/or effort which could lead to you working much longer than necessary in order to make whatever financial goal you have. In my own experience having worked on mturk for two years, the biggest issue is still what I mentioned in the beginning: set hours. Do not let work bleed into family life.

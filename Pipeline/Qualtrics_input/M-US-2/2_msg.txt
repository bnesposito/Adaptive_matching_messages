Alot of people bring their work home with them. They carry it in and set it down on the floor and it gets in the way of finding balance. Alot of people work from home and they have no where to hide from the day to day. I am one of these people. The work is littered around the house and I trip over it. I have felt this way more days than I can remember. My family needs so much from me and the things that I give are causing us to not be able to relax. The stress radiates throughout the home life an office still buzzing after a busy day. 
I continue to live in the same mindset as if I never clock out. My shift never ends. I never go home and unwind and get ready to face another day. 
There needs to be a separation from work and home. Even small differences in your day add up. The clutter will begin to disappear and you'll feel a weight lift off of you. You have so much to offer your family and the environment and relationships you have in your life. Every day is an opportunity to move forward with them.

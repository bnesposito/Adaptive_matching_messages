I find it fairly easy to reconcile online mTurk work with family obligations.  That is one of the great parts about online work.  You can choose your own hours and structure your work day in such a way that you can both go online and earn money making HITs, as well as still keeping your family obligations. For example, if your kids are home from school right now, they can be in the same room with you, working on their school work, while you are right there available helping them, instead of you being at a part time job outside the household.  Another option, if you need to be there for your kids full time during the day, you can work on mTurk after the kids have gone to bed at night.  mTurk works goes round the clock, so you can pick a time that doesn't interfere with your family time.  The best part is, the extra money that you can bring in working online can be a great way to help you meet your family financial obligations. You can also use that extra money to take a vacation, take your kids to an amusement park, a movie or out to dinner. It is great way to benefit your family.

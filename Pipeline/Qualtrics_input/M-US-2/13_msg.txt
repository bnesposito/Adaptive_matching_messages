In order to make time for both online work and family obligations you should set a time limit on working. I find it very tempting to work on MTurk all day long. Unfortunately this means that I often forget to do things around the house like wash the dishes, do laundry, etc. I have to set a specific time that I will work and then log out and close the MTurk page. Make sure that if you have made plans to spend time with your family or friends you set a reminder on your electronic device and then stop working when it goes off. Make a list of all the things you need to accomplish during the day and schedule time to focus on each task. It is very important that you make time for your family. Make sure they know that they are more important that your work. It is fine to work online but make sure to set time limits so you can maximize your time both working and spending time with family. Let your family know what hours you are going to work each day and stick to that schedule. Put your family first, keep work in it's place.

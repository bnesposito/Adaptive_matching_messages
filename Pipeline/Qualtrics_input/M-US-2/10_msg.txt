Hello, how are you doing? I know that being able to balance work and family obligations can be very tough. What i like to do is give myself a set amount of hours to do online work. During these times, i would not want to be bothered at all. My mind would only be focused on my work so i can do the best that i can. Something that helps with this is closing your door or giving yourself a room only for working. Another thing that really helps is wearing headphones and listening to music or podcast. This helps keep out outside noise to distract you. Once your time is over and you've worked all the hours you've worked, you can go about your day and take care of whatever else you need to do. I usually work for about 8 hours and then spend the rest of the day doing house work or doing things i enjoy like playing video games or exercising. Being able to balance work and family obligations is very important because it helps you balance your life so you are not so stressed out. Not being stressed out is the key to online work because you kind of have to force yourself to do it and you are your own boss.

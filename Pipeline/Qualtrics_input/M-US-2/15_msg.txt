I begin my online work early in the morning before the rest of my family gets up for the day.  That usually allows me to get an hour or more of work before any family matters get underway.  Often, lunch and dinner times represent a lull in work (presumably because other workers are taking time off to eat). That gives me a few breaks in the day to handle home and family matters.    

I always prioritize my work queue based on importance and the amount of time required versus allotted.  I also consider other workers' reviews to make sure I do not spend valuable time on tasks with negative feedback.  These steps allow me to use my time efficiently, creating more time with my family.  

In the end, health and family are most important to me and I will take time out of work when something is needed.  I am fortunate that my work is somewhat flexible so I can work into the evening (or early mornings) to get things done.  That gives me some flexibility to manage family matters in between.

I always remember something I was once told by an older gentleman with whom I worked.  He said "When I die, they won't carve on my gravestone that I was a great plant manager.  They will say I was great husband, father, grandfather."  I think that sums things up for me in terms of family being more important that work.

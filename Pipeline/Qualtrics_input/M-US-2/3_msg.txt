I would just like to say that I am working from home still and live in a small house and have a child, which kind of makes it very difficult to manage everything. So, I have started getting more patient and mostly trying to work in a separate room away from the whole family. As I do live in a very small house that is difficult sometimes, so I actually did sit down my whole family and told them how to act when I am working and not disturbing me during. They understood that  I need space to work and did distance themselves from me.
You can also just try doing the work when everyone is asleep if that is possible or even wake up really early to do it. I mostly did my work when everyone was asleep which gave me peace of mind. I remember this one day I tried doing my work at night but couldn't and then ended up missing the day's pay, so you do have to get used to it to work. 
But, mostly I would really suggest that you should make your family understand that working in the home is going to part of their lives and they have to give enough space for that.

Reconciling work and family life allows men and women to achieve economic independence, and fulfill themselves both professionally and personally, while also discharging their family obligations. But it is bit difficult. As we work from home its difficult to manage to spend time on family obligations. for example in online work we don't know when will be we are working and the amount we are going to make. family members expect from us so many things from us. so it is very important to reconcile with family obligations by allocate proper time and energy to it. we have to spend time with kids and the kids nee more attention. and maintain the bond between them. so online workers don't have to sit all day in front of the computer but to spend time with the family matters and also make money . in some cases it is difficult but we have to explain to the family members about the nature of the work. and we all so try to keep the harmony going between the work and family obligations in my life i always drop kids to the school and sometimes cook for the family. y wife is not working so i was only sole breadwinner of my family. but the difficult in working home is far more difficult as everyone think

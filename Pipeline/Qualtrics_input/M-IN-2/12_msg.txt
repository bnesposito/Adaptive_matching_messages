If you need to, take 10 minutes to shower and change before you sit down with the children. Children pick up on moods and will sense your unhappiness with the family routine if you run in, complaining about hold ups at work, or missed meals and late bedtimes. If it’s late and they’ve already eaten, get into the habit of sitting down and enjoying a light snack and a chat with them before they go up to bed.
It doesn’t have to be anything special or take very long. The fact is your children will just enjoy being around you for a short time each day - while you water the garden, take the dog round the block, or pick up their brother or sister from a friend’s.
 Bath time, story time, or both if there’s time. If you have relaxed and eaten, it will help low energy levels, and may help you keep your eyes open during that bedtime story! 
 You know your children don’t need, or want, full on entertainment, just having your quiet company while they play in the bath or a short story at bedtime will be enough for them. Then you can watch your children settle down happy to know you're there.
Movie night, Lego night or computer game night. Whatever they fancy. Few dads can join in with their children’s post-school fun and games every evening, but your children will love to know that there’s one night when everything stops, just for them.

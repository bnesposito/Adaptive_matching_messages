Reconciling online work with family obligations can be challenging since you're typically working in the same space where your family is living.  I would recommend setting aside certain blocks of work time and certain blocks of family time.  That way your family knows exactly when you're working and won't interrupt you.  But they also know when you'll be taking breaks, so if they need your child for a few moments those would be the times to come find you. I'd also take some time to politely reiterate that your online work is a legitimate source of income for your family, and without it you will be worse off.  It is not possible for you to work consistently and tend to all of your families distractions at the same time, so that is why you set these boundaries and schedules.  Finally, you might consider finding alternative work environments where you cannot be bothered.  Surely your family would understand if you had to travel to a non-online job, so perhaps you might need to travel to a quieter place for part of the day when working on your online job.  The reason for this would be to maximize your productivity, and I would phrase this as wanting to earn the most income possible for your family.

I think that reconciling online work has become the need of the day. A person can meet his family obligations and work at the same time. He can get a good support from the family. At the same time he can earn a good amount of money Doing online work has become the need of the hour and at the same time one can earn a good amount of money. This was the time when I was promoted in my office. I had complete power over other subordinates. I demanded work from them. I felt very much happy and satisfied. I also felt very much proud. I felt that I am very much in control of the situation. My subordinates respected me and followed my orders. Once I gave a work target and my subordinates had to achieve the target in time. I had maintained discipline in my department and due to this the subordinates achieved the target well in time. I felt that I had made a good decision. A person can get a good reputation and develop good relation with the family members.A person can also get a good support once he reconciles the work. It has become the need of the hour.

As of my experience working online at home is best... that too am female and suits best for me. i can manage my home duties. i can manage my children too. i can manage my kitchen work and cooking. as well as i do online job too. whenever i get a time i do my hobbies. it is very convenient option especially for female. and too for home makers and house wives this is very worth that we spent time in online job and we get paid for our work. if we spent a lot of time in online job we get paid as much as we spent. while doing this online job we can do multitasking work too. only thing you should know that how to manage your time according to your work. as i said female are always do multitasking very well and this is best for females i think. you can do all your household work and also can do online job too. but you have to learn the skills to manage your time. first it will be difficult but later on if you get to manage your time it will become easy.... remember nothing is impossible.

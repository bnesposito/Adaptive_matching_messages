For parents, however, this means optimal organization and perfect time management to reconcile family life and work. You can quickly reach your limits when it comes to offering the children an optimal activity progam. The Roche Vacation Programme is designed to support Roche employees in this process. It offers children between the ages of six and twelve a wide range of entertainment options. For example, parents can choose whether their child goes on a "research vacation", attends the "sports camp" or wants to participate in the "autumn vacation program". Another benefit is the joint lunch for the employees at the early stage of the work. Here, children of school age who are not looked after during the holidays are given a warm lunch, thus facilitating the reconciliation of professional and private life. The "parent-child office" has been in place since 2015. It offers Roche employees a quick and flexible solution in the event of a childcare shortage. This allows parents to make important appointments and at the same time they can be sure that their children are in good hands. It also offers the opportunity to network with colleagues and other family members working at Roche, to share care and, for example, to take part in meetings. Its all about online work with family obligation

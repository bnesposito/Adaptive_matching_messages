I think that the best way to have working online from home and not neglecting family obligations is to make sure you give everything the time it is due. You can't work 12 hour days seven days a week and stay on the computer all the time, or whatever the extreme maybe. You have to set a schedule of the work is not already scheduling and stick to it so that you still have time to take care of and do things with your family. 
When I first started online work I often worked at least ten hours a day online and then went to a second job after that for at least two or three hours a day. It was doable but it did not leave me for much time for anything else. So I started making sure I worked by a schedule and even dropped the second job to make sure I was home with my family and not leaving friends feeling like I forgot about them or was being rude. But I don't have those problems anymore unless I just get consumed with work and forget to take off time when I am supposed to to uphold my obligations.

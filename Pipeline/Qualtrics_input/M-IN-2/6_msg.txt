In order to reconcile online work with family obligations, first, make sure to set aside time specifically for both. This might involve creating a schedule that clearly outlines when you are working and when you are "off the clock." This way, you and your family will know when you have to be working, and when you are free to chat, help the kids with homework, and enjoy your time with them. 

Second, make sure to create a separate workspace for your online work that is free from distractions. You could use an office, guest bedroom, or even patio if you have one. Wherever you pick, talk with your family about how during your "work hours" that is your space and go over what that means. It might mean you don't mind if they are around you, but they have to be quiet. Or it might mean they can be there, but if you are on a video call or phone call, they should go to another area. Come up with this decision with your family so you can all agree on something that makes sense together. 

Lastly, make sure that you make time for family obligations. In your schedule, make sure to include things like "make dinner with my wife," or, "go to the park with my son." That way, your family will be reassured you will still make time for them despite working online 8 or more hours a day. This will likely decrease interruptions during the work day.

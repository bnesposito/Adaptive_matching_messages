Reconciling online work with family obligations can be tricky. There’s a fine balance that comes with making sure you spend enough time with your family and having the time to make some money online. I would say that you always need to make sure your family is taken care of first unless you’re really hurting for money. I’ve had times where I neglected family time to do online work. It just results in hurt feelings on your family’s part, even if you have a few extra dollars in your bank account. That extra stress certainly is not worth it. Just monitor your time and consider setting a time limit for your online work. Ask your family members, too, about how much time you’re spending with them and online and see if they think it’s at an acceptable level. Their feedback can be instrumental to having a good balance. Family is very important and valuable and you want to keep them happy. Don’t let your online work supersede your family, no matter how much you may enjoy the online work. It will be available at another time but your family may not be. Go enjoy the quality time with your family when you’re able!

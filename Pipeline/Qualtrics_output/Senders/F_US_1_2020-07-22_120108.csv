Second, make sure to create a separate workspace for your online work that is free from distractions. You could use an office, guest bedroom, or even patio if you have one.

Lastly, make sure that you make time for family obligations. In your schedule, make sure to include things like ""make dinner with my wife,"" or, ""go to the park with my son."" That way, your family will be reassured you will still make time for them despite working online 8 or more hours a day. This will likely decrease interruptions during the work day.

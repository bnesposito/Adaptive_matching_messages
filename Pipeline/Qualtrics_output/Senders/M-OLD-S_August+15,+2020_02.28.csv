We are both busy during the day doing our own thing, but we are getting older now and our time is limited.  Some things are just more important in life than making money.  Just yesterday it seems like I was 30.  Life passes fast.  I think everyone should make time do other things, especially taking time for friends and family.  This year my Mom and my wife's Dad died.  I wish I could have spent more time with both of them.  Now that they are gone, I will never have that chance again.  If you have kids, they also grow up very quickly and before you know it they are gone off on their own.  And the more time spent working, the less time being spent with them.  Live your life, enjoy you time while you are young.  One of the worst things is growing old and realizing how much you missed.

Nobody's perfect, and probably few are are perfect and productive and loving to their family as you imagine them to be.

So give yourself a break.  Families, and especially young children, are very resilent. As long as your family knows you love them, then can forgive a lot. You would forgive them for mistakes, right?  So know that they will forgive you, and certainly don't expect you to be perfect. It's okay to tell them you wish you could do more, but there are only so many hours in a day, and we have only a limited amount of energy. 

If your boss has ever had such responsibilities, they may understand more than you imagine. They might have older parents they're concerned about. So be honest to both your boss and your family.

Because of its nature, online work demands a degree of quiet and isolation. This is perhaps the most difficult aspect of it, but it needs enforcement if the work is to be successful (and frustration kept to a minimum). So how does one manage the two most important areas of ones life? Best practice, IMO, is to apply a firm schedule or structure to the balance between work and social responsibilities; a conscious application of time away from the work devoted to household relationships and other matters; deviation from this schedule *only* when the work or the relationship life of the home demand it (this last has to be a judgment call on the part of the worker). Since the time spent at work online (especially on Mechanical Turk) is flexible to some extent, time-outs in which social responsibilities and self-care can be attended to should be built into the day as a rule. This would be the case with a standard career offsite, the only difference being that the worker creates it himself--thus the schedule can be more flexible--rather than accepting an employer's structure. This schedule should be shared with everyone in the family who might have an interest in it, and everyone should give input to feel invested in the project. Positive family support of the online worker is crucial to success.","I'm semi-retired, 70, and by myself in my living situation at present, but this is only a recent condition, and I have long experience juggling my work and significant other social responsibilities.

I have been working from home for 22 years and I love it.  First off, work should be treated just as if you were going into the office and you need to establish a set start and stop time and adhere to it.  You need to ensure that you are not interrupted during those times, except for emergency.  You need to have a separate room/office to work, not on the dining room table or living room sofa.  You need to be able to close your door during sensitive discussions that your family should not hear.  If you talk on a phone for business, you need to have a separate line that the kids or family can't pop on, listen in, or tie up.  It needs to be dedicated for work.  You should take your normal breaks and lunch time.  Spend lunch with the family if they are at home.  After getting used to the routine, you may find that you are able to manage some other things during working hours, such as starting a load of laundry before work, and then on morning break, move it to the dryer, and at lunch time, remove it and put it away.  You need to get up and stretch - you're not in a prison.  Occasionally, it is nice to take your equipment outside in nice weather and work from there if possible, but be sure to avoid distractions.  You are working, and that should be your primary focus during working hours.  Remember, at quitting time for the day, log off, get up and leave your office.  Don't say you'll just finish a few more things - think of it as leaving the office to pick up the kids or something like that - it is a hard stop that you must adhere to.  These tips should give you a great experience.","Reconciling online work with your family obligations can be fairly easy, as long as you set and follow some guidelines.

I have a very modest pension and social security coming in, and my online work harvests maybe another twenty five percent on top of that. The end result is that I have to live very frugally. I can do that. I am an old widower, and live alone. I paid off my home a long time ago, and my expenses are comparatively low. My kids are all off on their own, so my family obligations are mainly communication over the phone and email. My garden supplements my food supply, and I don't eat out. My social life is comprised of visiting with people in the nearby town and on the beaches, and that is down to a bare minimum with the pandemic. Hard times!
Honestly, I do not know how people are making it now a days. We used to be able to get a job that covered our expenses and left some for saving for the future. It looks pretty tough out there to me these days. If you have kids and only one income coming in, I do not see much room for saving and investing in your future in today's economy. 
If you are single with no dependents, that is another story. Online work can support you if you work long hours and get efficient at it. But if you have a family to support, my hat is off to you. At least you can work at home and have some kind of balance in your family life. Cut expenses as much as you can and live frugally and you can feed the pack, but it won't be easy.

A lot of the time your family doesn't understand what is expected and it may seem like they are being inconsiderate, when they aren't aware of what you are doing. So make sure they know that they are not being ignored, but that you need that time to get work done. Once everyone knows everyones schedule it will help a lot. It is also helpful to have a designated work space. That way when your family sees you in this space they know that you are working and that you are not to be bothered. It doesn't have to necessarily be a separate room, but a desk or the dining room table could be used. If they see you sitting on the couch in your pajamas, they aren't aware you are working and could mistake it for you just wasting time on your computer. But if you look professional and are sitted in a specific location that they know your work from, they are going to be less likely to bother you. And the faster your work gets done the more time you have to spend with them. Make sure they understand this. That you are focusing now to have more time later for them. If you have kids it may be important for your spouse to help explain this to the kids and help teach them when they can and can't interrupt.

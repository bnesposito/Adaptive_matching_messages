Depending on what is convenient, you can set aside time at the beginning, mid, or end of day to do your online work.
Then, in the free time you have, you can find some time to dedicate to spending time with your family and doing whatever it is you need to with them. If you can stick to a schedule, then you and your family will know what to expect.

That aside, it would also be good to communicate with your family clearly so you and them both know what to expect. You can explicitly tell them how much time your work requires and then they can tell you how much of your time/ attention they would like to not feel dismissed or ignored. Once you know both of these things, you can find a balance where everyone's needs are met.  It's hard to be disappointed if you know what to expect and what's being reasonably offered to you. This is the sort of conversation I've had with my family and we haven't had these sort of issues anymore.","It would be beneficial to structure your day in a way where you dedicate blocks of time to specific activities/ responsibilities.

It is through this kind of balance we can make sure we manage family obligations and also get work done. I think the way I see it is that online work is important, but can be done in ways that do not end up impacting relationships to other people in daily life. Like only working when there are not neccesarily family members around or stuff like that. I think it's important to balance and not always be online for work when loved ones are around to spend quality time with them too.

Another way to reconcile obligations with online work is to carve out specific time for both. So it can be a helpful think to basically set up times you have online work only, and other times you have family time only. I think having that balance of specific time is really helpful. It ends up making you feel like you can have both your online work and you family relationships together.

Then I take client calls, check emails and do any small tasks that need to be done throughout the day that don't take as much attention and preoccupation so that I can multitask or jump between my work and my family as needed.

In my experience, setting aside specific times to work online helps be to be productive and efficient. If I have an important meeting or deadline to meet, I will alert my family in advance so that they know not to bother me (unless of course, if there was an emergency). Since working online is often done in your home, with the family nearby, creating a solid boundary between your work and home life is absolutely crucial to finding a balance. If possible, it helps to have a separate room (or even a designated space in a room) where you will work. I have also found it extremely helpful to make schedules and set goals for myself for the week and beginning each morning.

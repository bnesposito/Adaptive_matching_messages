Considering that you already have experience working on MTurk online work is nothing new and you should realize the advantages of working online. The flexibility in the time spent and working hours provided by online work is unmatched by traditional work. You can take breaks easily and work during times you are more efficient. 

Personally, I experienced a strenuous transition to online work when it first started. I could manage my time properly or spend enough time doing my chores or spend time effectively with my family. But once I got used to a routine and realized that everyone was working online, it provided me with more time to spend with family and take care of household chores. We started spending more time together as a family and had family game nights playing cards almost every night. My work efficiency decreased a little initially but I managed to utilize new digital tools to improve it and spending time around family improved my motivation to work. I managed to complete most of my chores from gardening and helping around in the kitchen earlier than usual since I anyway spent my time at home. Doing household tasks gave me a much-needed break from work when I was struggling with a problem at work. I hope you can also find ways to incorporate online with family obligations soon and be safe during this pandemic.","Working online during the pandemic is a necessity for everyone.

Others will begin to notice a change in attitude or demeanor, creating cause for concern. People will think that you are neglecting them, even if that is not your honest intention. Now, it's not the worst thing in the world to prioritize work at certain times, though it should go without saying that people are not meant to work 50+ hours a week. It has become so deeply embedded in American culture that hard work almost always leads to success and rewards. That could not be further from the truth. We need to incentivize for systemic change in our workforce, where people should feel just as rewarded working ~30 hours a week as they would working a job that requires them to essentially sacrifice their lives in order to pay the bills and afford basic necessities.

I am a coder and I have two kids and I work from home and my wife doesn’t and it can be a struggle to get work done because we don’t have a baby sitter and when I get really hard projects I don’t work on them until my wife gets home and then I’ll get an energy drink and then do my eight hours of actual work after that. Some nights can be so tiring but seeing the smiling faces of your baby makes it so worth it. Another way is to ask for space if your partner stays home and you can work on your projects for two through three hours at a time and take some breaks inbetween to refresh.

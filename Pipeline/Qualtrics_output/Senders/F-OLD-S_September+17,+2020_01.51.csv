This is such a great teaching moment for children to see their parent working and achieving work success.  So many people do not share with their children what their education is for and what they can achieve if they obtain a degree of higher learning.  They can also be taught that getting that degree could mean the difference between doing endless work on mturk and getting a better paying job that gives one a better sense of self worth.,I find that people think that online work is not the same commitment as working in a brick and mortar establishment.

It's also important that you take care of yourself.  This will be the hardest thing of all -- carving out a time of day to relax.  Even if it's just half an hour to sit  outside in the twilight, or chat on the phone with a friend, do it.  You're the glue that holds it all together.

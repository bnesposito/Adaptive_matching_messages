We don't have any children, aside from a fur-child, but I still think I can help since I have grown children and can therefore remember them being at home...

Since I'm able to create my own schedule, I always work during the day, when my other half is also working, and then we relax together in the evening. I imagine that if we/I had children, I would schedule myself frequent breaks so as to spend time with them. If they were very young, I may even try to work more when they're sleeping. If they were older and quiet wasn't a necessity for my job, I'd have the child(ren) in the room with me, perhaps with a child-friendly show on. During the commercials, I'd ask what happened during the previous block and ask if they had any thoughts on it or if they wanted to share anything about it, like what they liked best and worst and if they could think of a way to behave better than a character, et.

I would also make sure to make meals quality time, eating them and perhaps making them, if the child(ren) is old enough.

Insofar as my better half, when I take breaks, we get together if only for a few minutes, to hug and share a quick kiss.","I too work from home, as does my boyfriend.

When I first started working from home, I thought I would never get used to it.  It seemed as though there was no line drawn between the two.  It all overlapped.  This was not good for my family not was it good for my work.  I sat down with my family one evening and discussed the matter at hand.  I wanted input from everyone, not just from me.  Afterall, we are a family.  We all listened and at the end we came up with a schedule that we thought would work.  My online work hours would be from mid-morning to late afternoon.  Early morning would be family time before the kids went to school and hubby to work. Everyone pitched in to clear the kitchen and they were off.  I finish up some minor kitchen details.  I then have 30 minutes of ""me time' with my coffee.  After that, I start my onine work without any interruptions.  I have about 5 hours for my work.  Then I start dinner for the family.  After we finish eating, we all again pitch in to clean up the kitchen.  Then the kids head upstairs for their homework and ""their"" time.  I have about 2 plus hours to wrap up my online work.  Then hubby and I go up to get the kids in bed.  
There will be times when something may interfere with the routine but if we all work together, we can get this done.  The important thing is to make sure you have your work hours separated from your family time.  You cannot be doing your work efficiently if you do not give it your full attention.  Make separate time for the family.  On weekends, it is time for a small celebration.  Go out for dinner, a movie, or treat the kids to McDonalds.   Do not ignore your family.  Make sure they understand that work is work, whether it is done at the office or at home.

Both are pretty important. I have been doing online work for a while, so maybe I can offer some ideas. However, you are the expert on your own family, so just take any ideas that seem helpful and ignore the rest, OK?

It helps to plan your online work for times that your family is less likely to need you. If you have small children, of course, their needs are less predictable. In that case, you can choose to do your online work when they are sleeping, or when someone else is watching them. With older children and/or your spouse, you can let them know you will be working, and check to see if they need anything before you start.

One of the advantages of online work is that it can be done on your own schedule. If an emergency need arises in your family, you can sign off of the MTurk survey, knowing you can work later. You can even plan your online work in the middle of the night, if you can manage to fit that in with your needed sleep.

I suggest thinking hard about how much you need the wages you earn from your work. That can be your guide for how hard you need to fit the work around your family needs. More need could mean you would be willing to put up with greater inconvenience.

Like I said before, you are the expert on what your own family needs. Planning ahead should help your balance your work and family obligations.

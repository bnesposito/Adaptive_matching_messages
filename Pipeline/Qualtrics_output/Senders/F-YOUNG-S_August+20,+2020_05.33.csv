Stick to the hours you choose to work, and do not work outside of these hours. Another thing you should do is have a dedicated place in your house where you work. The only thing you should do in that place is work. You should not eat, spend time with the family, or watch Netflix in that place. The place could be a room in your house, or even a section in your room. Just make sure that whatever room you choose is free of distraction. Do not do any work outside of that dedicated place.

These are important factors in establishing the work-life balance. Other options could include considering daycare or adjusting working hours to fit around the schedule of your family.

The affordability of the daycare can be a major barrier because if the costs are too high then the workload must also increase which will cause it to be difficult to reconcile online work with family obligations. It may also be possible to negotiate working hours with your employer depending on what your job is. The work-life balance is very important to establish because one can become burnt out and detached from their family if they do not have the time to spend with them due to long work hours.

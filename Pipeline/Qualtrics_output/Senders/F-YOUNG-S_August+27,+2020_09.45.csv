I was able to surprisingly knock out quite a bit of my daily tasks and customer needs by just doing them as soon as they came in. What I noticed is this also allowed me to take care of my two kids that were out of daycare(since they were closed) and focus on family time even during my work hours. One of the things I enjoyed most about online work was the ability to spend time with my family, so I was trying extra hard so anytime a remote opportunity comes up I would be in good standing with my company to take them up on it. I hope that these words can help you. Another thing that made it fun was I would schedule certain sections of my day to make sure my kids were getting enough attention. Another thing that helped if possible was I could always remote in and just work whenever, so if I had an immediate concern with my children I could clock out and help them. But I would just remote in when they were asleep later and finished up my online work.","I had to work online and meet family obligations a while back due to the corona virus. a few takeaways that I gathered from it is always try to do your work as soon as you can.

Although you have the flexibility to both at once, you won't be as productive without establishing the proper borders. So, do your work within a certain time frame. Make yourself an office space. Having a quiet, comfortable space to work in can make all the difference! Decorate it to your liking. Make sure you feel relaxed. Tell your family they can interrupt only if it is very important. Allow yourself small breaks every now and then. This is a good way to start your plan for working at home.

My advice on balancing both things would be to create a schedule with your family, to make sure that everyone is getting time and attention. The family schedule could cover a day at a time, a week, a month, or whatever makes the most sense with your family. Every family member should have their own section of the schedule, so it makes it easier to see who has certain things schedules. Each family should discuss their schedules throughout the week, including work, school, and other important activities. Creating a family schedule will help to reconcile online work with family obligations, because everyone will get a clear picture of what needs to be done, and it also helps to schedule work around other family obligations.

I am no expert in the matter, but I have found a few things that help me and make my life a bit easier. The first thing I can say is to set specific hours for work. If you have a  specific time that you do work related things, it will not bleed over into your time for other activities. For example, say you work from 9-5 and the time outside of those hours is for you, family, and whatever else needs to get done. The second thing I can recommend is having a dedicated work space, away from the stressors of daily life. Whether it be a desk in a room or a closet, one should have a space that they can go to work undisturbed and complete all of their tasks in a timely manner. The last thing I can think of is letting your family help you with work related tasks. Obviously, you work and not them, but there may be easy tasks or activities you can divide off that can help streamline our work and keep the family busy at the same time.

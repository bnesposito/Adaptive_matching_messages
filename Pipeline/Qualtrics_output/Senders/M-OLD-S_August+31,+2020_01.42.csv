You don't necessarily need to close the door, but it should be a separate space. This way you can clearly focus on your online work. There maybe other times when you can catch up on less intensive tasks... such as answering emails or managing your schedule, when you are in ""shared space"" with the family. In this mode, you can be with the family and respond to them as needed, but when the family is watching TV or just hanging out in the room together, you can tend to your work, always being ready to put it down if need be.

5. Can I split my workday into several shorter periods, say 6 am to 8 am, 9 am to 12 noon, and 3 pm to 7 pm?
6. Do I need to interact with co-workers in different time zones or even different parts of the world like Europe or Asia?
The overall schedule needs to balance your family and work obligations. It is also very important to leave some time for relaxation and fun. Set aside and block an hour for family dinner every day, say 7-8 pm. This hour everybody knows that you are NOT available for work meetings no matter what.
Also, block out some time to be alone with your husband. Both of you need time for intimacy and loving to preserve and grow your relationship.

For example, one may want to get dressed up for work even though no one is leaving the house. 

 A key aspect to maintaining a routine is to not frequently take advantage of the flexibility that working at home allows.  While it might be great to spontaneously do an activity with one's child on a whim, this is a long term killer to maintaining boundaries between the two worlds.

One has to also communicate to co-workers and supervisors that you may not be available to respond immediately to emails as it may fall within your designated family time.

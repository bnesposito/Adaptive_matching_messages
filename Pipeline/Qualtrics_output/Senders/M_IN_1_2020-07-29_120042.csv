Work and family both need your time. However, if you plan ahead and have the support of people around you - you can balance both. 

Planning can come down to deciding how time you want to dedicate to work and your family. Choosing a time of the day when you’re most productive (work) can make a big difference. But it still won’t amount to much without the support of the people you’re with. 

Talk to them, and communicate openly about what your needs are. And don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. 

In a lot of cases, people make it hard for themselves when they don’t open up and ask for help. It’s often the simplest things in life when ignored, builds into something bigger. Come to think of it, reckon it holds true wherever in the world you may be. 

It’s by no means an easy call when you have to choose between work and family - I’ve been there myself. But, all said and done, I think it helps to remind ourselves - work is work, and family is family.

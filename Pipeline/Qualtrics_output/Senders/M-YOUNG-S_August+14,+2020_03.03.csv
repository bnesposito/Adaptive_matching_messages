It can be hard dealing with intersecting responsibilities but that is what is happening since you primarily work online when you are at home. I think you should block out times in your day to work and know that if you are more productive then, you can spend more time with your family later on.

Despite all of that, I consider my family to be priority number one. You should set yourself up to put them in the best position, and sometimes that requires sacrificing a little bit on the work side. A good company will support you in those roles and allow you the flexibility to attend to family matters as long as you work diligently in your capacity as an employee. 

Since I have worked at home, I consider my work to be of the same standard as it was when going into the office. I make money and I am actually able to spend more time with my family because I don't have to commute and can use that extra time to be with my kids. It is amazing the difference it can make and I'm glad I work for a company that helps me with these goals. Sometimes you need to work and that is OK, but the key is to have a healthy balance and realize that your family should come first.","I just want to say that you should focus on what is most important to you.

Maybe you could suggest breaking up your lunchtime into several smaller chunks throughout the day so you can take care of your family obligations.

I would also talk to whoever it is that is your ""family obligation"" and try and work with them about it. Maybe you could work together and communicate to come to a solution. 

If none of this works. Then I would say you need to be very very firm about how you have this job and need to be able to have uninterrupted time each day to complete your work. 

Additionally, some of these obligations could possibly be solved after/before work. Maybe if your obligation is to make lunch for your child or children, then you could make their meals the night before after work. You could also try and spend more time with your family outside of work so they don't feel like they need you while you're working.","I would say that as long as your family obligations aren't emergencies, that you need to block off your work hours each day and not let anyone else interrupt your work time.

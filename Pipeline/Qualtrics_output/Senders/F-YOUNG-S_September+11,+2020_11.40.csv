It's surprisingly easy to blend work and family obligations when working from home, as you're not physically moving from home to the workplace and vice versa. It's important to make sure to completely stop working once you've clocked out or finished for the day, and although it's tempting to read work-related emails or texts if you receive them only minutes after clocking out, it's best to turn off work notifications once you're done for the day. After work, you have time to fully concentrate on your family obligations.

If your work does not have dedicated clocking in/out procedures and you must be on call, I suggest making a list of family/home obligations and assigning estimated completion times for each task. When on call and there's downtime, only work on one task from the list, and don't try to rush to complete the task.

If you live with a significant other, it's helpful to keep each other accountable in balancing your own work/life. If one of you notices the other is swamped with online work and is getting stressed out, suggest taking a quick break to distance yourself from the chaos.","To keep a good work-life balance, my best advice is to create a schedule and stick to it.

It was an adjustment at first, but as the weeks went on it became easier for others to obey the privacy for an office. Whenever the time restrictions aren't followed it is important to discipline as to not set a precedent of it being okay to barge into the office space at any time.

Part of my own obligations include things like tidying up the house, doing laundry, watching my baby nephew while my sister is at work, and occasionally cooking meals.  I absolutely love jobs like mTurk because I can not only have the online work, but I can do it at my own pace.  However, I find still setting apart a rough day to day schedule to follow helps a lot in balancing work and home duties.  Plan for an average time you want to wake up every morning.  When will you eat breakfast?  When will you take your first break, and for how long?  Make sure to schedule some time for household cleaning as well.  On days where I'm cooking or watching my nephew, I likewise schedule my online work around my family obligations.  In my particular case, since I'm watching my nephew for my sister, I'm also being paid as a FFN provider during that time, so I'm not losing as much potential money I would have had from work.  One thing I've also noticed is that there are certain times of day where more HITs tend to be uploaded.  Keeping that in mind and scheduling your non time limited household duties (such as sweeping the floor) before or after those HIT blocks also gives you the most money for your time.  Above all, remember the importance of your partner, spouse, children, and/or pets and their needs, and be aware if some sites that you work on will allow you to take an emergency break (Here on mTurk, you have the option to return a HIT for example, while some HITs give you more than enough time to complete their HIT.  Some sites will allow you to pause a recording, or give you a date deadline rather than a timed one.).  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and hope that this helps some!","Lately I've been in a position where I'm currently learning and putting into practice reconciling online work with family obligations.

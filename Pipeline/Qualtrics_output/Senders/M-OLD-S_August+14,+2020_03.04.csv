Ok that being said it isn't Rocket science here. Whether you work outside the home or in it online or offline. A 40 hr week is the full time assumption. How I worked it out is  after having over 30 years of working full time out of the home , I quickly realized that it wasn't me that had to adapt as much as my family did. My work time is MY work time and MY WIFE AND KIDS MUST RESPECT THAT and go about their day like I wasn't home whatever that may be. I am self disciplined enough to keep myself focused , but others in the home need to have the attitude that you are NOT available for 8 hrs or more. Just like when I worked outside the home. This is the only way it works no matter how committed YOU are. The entire home has to be on board and respect the unavailabilty. Period!!!","Ok so working from home is one thing, but working from home if you have children is another deal entirely. Ok that being said it isn't Rocket science here.

If you are just dabbling in online or at home work , then that is an entirely different matter. All the above is for someone trying full time work online from home.",0,5,gone

Every time you have any spare time search for qual or screener in the MTurk system.  This will bring up qualification or screener hits.  Doing these will expand your qualifications and in turn open up more available work to you.  Also look at the tools that you are using.  There are various tools out there to choose from.  One of the main must have's that became available only a couple of years ago is an extension on chrome (I believe it is also available on other's too) called MTurk Suite.  This is a must have.  The tracker will tell you how many hits you have completed in dollars, there is also a 'catcher' which helps you catch those hits that you want to work on but cannot catch then manually.   The Finder will alert you when a favorite requester starts to post work, this you can customize to your own preferences. You can also adapt this to your own work schedule for searching hits.  One last thing if you are not sure how to use these tools that you find Youtube is a really good resource as there are multiple how to videos posted on this subject.  With all this it will be a lot easier and you will find you can work any time of day whenever you have a spare moment from your own obligations.","Hi, my advice is pretty simple.

Clear ground rules are the first step in helping alleviate this situation. Calmly let your family know that from such and such time to such and such time they need to imagine that you have left home for the office.

Secondly, if at all possible work in another room in the house, preferably with a door that you can shut.

It's best if you can implement these things right away and not wait until you and your family have started bickering about things, as that may make them feel that they are being punished etc. But even in that case it is still important to be assertive and let them know what you need.

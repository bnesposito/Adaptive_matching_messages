Therefor you must weigh the importance of each when making a decision of which should tale precedence. For instance if it is a choice between attending your daughters graduation or working online to pay a credit card you should probably accept the late fee and the hit to your credit rating and go to the graduation. Most situations will not be as clearly defined. Maybe you should work to pay your credit card debt rather than help your daughter with her homework. Her grade on her home work is probably not as important to your family as you meeting your obligations and maintaining your credit rating. It is often difficult to weigh these smaller decisions. You should always try to seek a balance between family and work. As you grow older you may find that you regret more the time missed with your family more than even fairly large financial set backs. Each person must decide for themselves what is most important to them. That decision should include input from family members. If you are getting complaints about not spending enough time with your family you should make an effort to insure that the time you spend with them is quality time.,It is important to meet family obligations however it is also important to meet your financial obligations.

Multi tasking between home and working online is not effective in any way.  I know it is convenient for family members to ask you to do things or leave the office area for a few minutes to check in on people, but what is happening there is a lack of boundaries.  The healthiest thing is to create boundaries, wither using time or activities to let others know when you are available and when you are not.  For example, being on the phone should be an automatic indicator that you are working and NOT available for family time.  Tell family members that when you have your phone or video conference going, they cannot interrupt unless it is an emergency.  Having clear times and during certain activities and having family members be quiet or not interrupt is healthy because having no limits or boundaries is not effective for work or family.  People need to know that work is a priority during the week and family will have to behave as if you are at the office   I find this is effective and avoids stress and anxiety.","In order to reconcile online work and family obligations, i find it best to be able to make time for both.  here's what I mean.

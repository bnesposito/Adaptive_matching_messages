The first of those is your level of being distracted. For me, this included my personal ability to concentrate based on the level of noise and activity that were present in my work environment and how often I was disturbed from that concentration. Second, I have learned that shutting yourself out to anything, except work, is important to getting work done properly and efficiently. Although, I did not have young children when I started working online, there was always music playing and other noise that could be heard. So, I moved my online work to a quieter area of my home. I also shut the door when noise and/or activity was above normal. This is something everyone has to figure out on their own, in consideration of their own environment. Lastly, I set a flexible schedule of when I wanted to complete my work, while not ignoring my obligation of my family. This was the toughest for me, as while I am at home, I feel I need to be present at all times for my family. So, what I did was set aside a specific number of hours and times each day to work, and remained flexible, if necessary. For example, I may have set to work from 10 am to 1 pm, but had to make lunch earlier. So, I worked from 10 am to 12 pm, made lunch, and went back to work from 1 pm to 2 pm. Flexibility has been a key factor, for me.","When in the early days of working online, there were many different factors that I found that I needed to consider.

Some people treat it like it is an interruption to their family life, but I always had a designated place to work and everyone in my family was aware that if I was in my working space that I was AT WORK. It also helped me to get up in the morning, shower and get dressed just like I was going into the office. I also kept to a strict schedule for breaks and lunch. Every hour I get up and stretch and walk around for a few minutes to keep from getting tired from the screen time. I also resist the urge to work too many hours. I log my hours into a spreadsheet every day to make sure that I am not going overboard trying to get things done in the evening. I try to log off at a reasonable hour, eat good foot and make sure that I get enough exercise. Good luck to you!!","I have been working from home online for many years.

You feel guilty because you need to earn money and yet you also feel guilty because your family should come first and they have needs. You need to treat it as a day job. Set an alarm. Get up. Go the space to do the online work and make it clear to everyone what your working time frame is. Perhaps you establish a time limit (i.e. forty minutes of work; then you will check in with the family to see what's going on). Or, perhaps a longer stretch works best for you. Everyone needs to know you are working from 10-2 and should only be disturbed for emergencies. You know the obligations that need handling for the family - you have to pencil that in to figure out the hours that can be given to your online work. From my perspective, early morning and late at night has been best for me to do longer assignments for work. I am less likely to be disturbed. Middle of the day, I have a lot of interruptions so my focus is distracted and that's not the best way to work. So I will only check in on work if I know I have a solid window of time to give to it and I will only accept shorter assignments at that time. Family can be unforgiving when it comes to wants and needs. Maddening almost. And they don't always understand your goals. So I say set that clock early - get it done in the morning. Crawl into bed at night, and get some more done. Then whatever else you can fit in during the day can be treated like gravy. And you get to give your family the attention they demand and need without feeling guilty. Hope that helps!","This is really challenging.

I would recommend focusing on one or the other carefully, without allowing the other to break your focus. This requires setting some boundaries. I would limit the number of hours you work, and also attempt to limit the number of interruptions by family members while you are working.

I can't say that I have always been a good example of this. When I work from home, my office door is usually open. My kids approach me often during the day. Depending on what I'm doing and how worried they look, I often allow them to interrupt me. I don't want to hurt their feelings and tell them to leave me alone. But, my children are very sensitive so life is always a delicate balance.

I will try to give some concrete advice. Use a good headset when you are working, one that blocks out noise in the house. Close the door to the room where you are working. When you are done working, be done for the day. Do not look at your work computer again, or your phone if you get work messages on your phone. Focus completely on your family at the end of the work day. Give them your full attention and love on them.

For me, I know that when I have had to do this, the best way that I've resolved it is to sit down and write down my personal priorities and my work obligations, and also write down things that I want to do vs. the things that I need to do. I look at my calendar, and I look at things that may be coming up soon that I need to attend to. In this way, I can do some planning. I also look at people that can help me, and that I can call on for advice and assistance.

I am writing trying to help you reconcile online work with family obligations. Let me tell you, it will require effort and commitment!. It will be challenging many times, but not undoable. First of all, you need to set boundaries in terms of time for family and time for work, and not let them interfere with each other. It is importwnt that you have a private space for work, where family should not interrupt at all. It is also important not to stay working longer than needed, and attend family needs according to the schedule you have set. Please dress up for work, even if you are at home, because that will sign your family about the role you are playing when dressed up: a worker, who has to be as efficient and productive as if you were in your office or workplace. But when you are with your family, don't answer work e-mail, clls, or texts. Don't even go to your work area, to avoid discvtracting yourself, and steal time that belongs to you and your family alone.","Hello fellow worker,

Holidays and week-ends are not to work, and even if you have a due date, try to keep in mind that if you work well focused during work days you can still meet all due dates. Enjoy working from home, and be strong to resist temptation to procrastinate, watch t.v or sleep longer, just because you don't have to punch your card.",0,34,gone

Make sure you are working in a separate room of the house where you are free from disturbances. Have a set time you work and make it clear you are only to be bothered in an emergency. Schedule breaks that allow you to check-in with everyone and know how everything is going in the home. Make sure you have a strict quitting time when work is over for the day. Allow this time after work to spend time with the family and to catch up on the day with each other. Do not allow work to bleed into your days off. Make sure days off are strictly family time. All this can help keep you from feeling overwhelmed by work or family because both have times where they are the priority. Make sure you do not get behind on work because it may make you feel you have to spend time on it outside of your set work hours. Hopefully, these tips help you keep good work and family balance. ","In order to keep a good work and family balance while working online at home one needs to follow some important rules. You must have a dedicated space for your work where you can be alone and will not be disturbed. Make sure everyone knows that while you are in this space they are not to interrupt you unless it is an emergency. Set work hours that are very specific and follow them. Make sure you schedule in breaks in order to check in on the household. Do not get behind on work so you do not feel you need to take up what should be family time trying to catch up on work. Make sure after work and days off are devoted strictly to family time. Do any errands and chores during this time so you are not behind on those. Make sure to have a family outing once a week where you and your family can spend quality time together. These tips should help you balance work and family. You not get overwhelmed by either and spend quality time on both. Doing this allows you to be happy with your work at home online life. Hopefully, this has helped.",0,35,gone

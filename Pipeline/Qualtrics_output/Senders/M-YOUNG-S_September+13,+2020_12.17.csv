Online work is the best for who is reasonable to work with Mturk and do their work without being bias with the decision and instructions laid down by the company.
I have decided to work voluntarily for Mturk since I will read all the instructions and obligations laid down by the requester.
I will advice all Mturk workers to find joy in helping others to solve their own problems for the advancement of the masses and companies in which the requester is.
My advice for everyone that works for Mturk is to have passion in solving others problems. 
Mturk is not what everyone can do but only those that has interest in reading and digesting what's been read so not all members of the family will have the passion to work for Mturk and those that don't have the passion for should not be coerced to join Mturk just because of the incentive.

So its important in my opinion to establish that so that there is a that balance between family and work. I would start by sitting down and drafting up a personal schedule that you can use to block out time for work and for family time. Most people are routine driven so if you can establish a consistent schedule that you will be that much closer to balancing work and family. It may take a couple revisions to your schedule but once you strike a satisfactory balance between time devoted to work and time devoted to family it should be just as mundane as when offices and the job site was open. 

Another critical element of a successful routine is to create the separation between your family space and a work space in my opinion. Its easy to become distracted by surrounding distractions within the house so creating a work space within the house that provides an environment for you to focus. I would set up a room where I'd place my computer and work desk which would allow me to shut the door so I could have that separation.

I would start by sitting down and drafting up a personal schedule that you can use to block out time for work and for family time. I don't know if it rings true for most, but I am very routine driven so my advice would be to establish and follow the schedule.

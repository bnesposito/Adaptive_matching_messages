I've tried, believe me.  

What generally winds up happening—depending on the type if paid work you do—if you try doing both your job AND childcare is this: You become exhausted and stressed, your kid(s) become stressed, your paid work suffers in productivity and quality, and it's just a mess...

I discovered that in order to effectively do my paid job, I had to treat it as if I were actually, physically leaving the house to go to work.  That means enlisting someone else I trust to provide care for the kids(s) while I'm working.  A family member could be useful here, but there are all kinds of affordable nanny and in-home childcare options out there you can find with some digging.

It can be tempting to try to do it all, but it really helps if you can set your work area up in an area of your home that has a door that can be closed. 
Firm ground rules have to be established to limit interruptions from kids, caregivers and others to emergencies only.  The first couple weeks will take some adjustment, but it's very worth it!

Good luck... It can be done! ","In my personal experience, I have found that, when working from home, it's incredibly difficult to be productive in my paid work AND my child caregiving responsibilities.  I've tried, believe me.

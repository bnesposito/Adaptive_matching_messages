Actually online working is sort of a blessing for those who can actually pull it off. You don't have to risk your neck commuting to a ""job"" every day. And you have much more time with your kids. You don't have to hire day care. So, consider yourself fortunate to be able to ""work"" this way. 
              It seems to me that setting a limit to your time of work is a responsible way to go.  Your work times should be consistent and predictable (not to be repetitive). I find that getting up really early -like around 530 am gets me started on the day on a good clip. I sometimes make more progress before 10:00 am than the rest of the day and afternoon all tolled. 
             The Mturk income is really not all that great, but, again, the upside is that you're not wasting time and money on commuting and all the other time wasters.","               I have no real family obligations myself, but I can imagine that it would be a big hassle and a chore in itself.

previously when I was working online I would work 12 to 16 hours a day and would end up completely worn out after a couple of days. Then I would have to take a couple of days off to rest up. Obviously this is not the best way to work online. The formula I gave you in the first paragraph is much better and will not wear you out as much when you are working online.

try to remember what's really important in your life.  sure it's nice to make money but you also have to take care of yourself everyday.  it is much too easy to overdo online work and end up totally exhausted.

    A lot really depends on the time you are willing to put in when you aren't on the clock.  For instance, just a simple trip to the ice cream store in the middle of the summer with the kids could give them the time they want to have with you the most. You will have to talk directly with your boss as well and see what the company requires while you are at home.  They do need to realize that, although they have corporate or business responsibilities, they should not be making more claims on your time just because it appears you have more ""free time"" at home.  In a sense, youre still clocked in.  So make it a point to communicate with your supervisors and set a specific time when you are devoted to your job.

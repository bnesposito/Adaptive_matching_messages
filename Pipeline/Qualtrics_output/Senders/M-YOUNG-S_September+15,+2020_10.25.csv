Working online has its benefits and drawbacks. In my experience, it has been extremely beneficial to balancing work and family obligations. 

Working online allows me to have a flexible schedule so I am able to balance work and family life. Working from home allows me to change my schedule or modify the hours I work in order to attend to family when I need to. If I need to drive a kid to practice or a school function it allows me the flexibility to do so. This is very important to me in my life. I had to miss a lot of these opportunities in the past when I wasn't working online. However, I do miss the feeling of going into work and seeing my co workers in person everyday. Now I just see them virtually during meetings. Also, not meeting with clients is hard to get used to since personal connection is important in my business. 

In conclusion, I think working online has allowed me to be closer to family and allow me to accomplish work and family obligations in a very beneficial way.

I would suggest setting up times for work, and times for spending quality time with your family. That way you can earn the money you need to earn distraction free, but also have time to keep your relationships in your family strong.

 I had to do the same thing before, I worked all day and my work/life balance was terrible, and then I stopped working much for family but that meant I stopped making money. Once I set strict and simple times for both of these activities, my work/life balance greatly improved and I did better and both work and family obligations. Now I can work at the peak times online while looking forward to time with my family, and spend time with them guilt free knowing that this time is solely for them. I can go to the park without even glancing at my phone, because it's simply not the time or place and this mindset benefits my whole family.

It will take some time to be strict on yourself and find what times work for you and your family, but one you have it set you're golden. A simple time to work and time for family obligations will let your family know when to expect you to be done and make your work/life balance much better.","It can be hard to reconcile online work with family obligations.

Secondly, I think it would be good to make sure that you implement a strong delineation between work life and home life. It's common for people who work at home to work late or respond to emails when they're supposed to be off the clock. But that can be a source of a lot of tension in your family relationships. You should have a set start time in the morning and a hard stop time in the evening. That way you don't get stuck in the cycle of ""just 15 more minutes"" when your family might be waiting on you for something.

I've been working online and remotely for a few years now, and I also have a spouse and a 2 year old child. I work full time and do Mechanical Turk.

For me, it's been most helpful to segment my time. For example, from 8am - noon, I'll work on things for my job. Noon - 1:00 pm, I eat lunch and play with my family, so that I can give them my full attention. After lunch, it's back to work -- my spouse will watch the kid so that I can focus completely on what I'm doing. The advantage of this is that it eliminates the need to multi-task, which lowers the quality of whatever you're doing (be it work or family matters). For Mechanical Turk, this will translate to being able to do HIT's with much greater speed and accuracy.

My last advice is to try not to do too much. For myself, whether through my job or through Mechanical Turk, it can be tempting to just get in there and ""grind"" all day to chase money. This is a bad idea and will strain important family relationships -- so know when to say enough is enough.","The most important thing for reconciling online/work from home situations and family obligations is balance.

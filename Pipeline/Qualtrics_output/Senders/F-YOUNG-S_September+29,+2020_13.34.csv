How much time do you want to actively spend with your family? And then plan ahead. Get yourself a diary or write down in your google calendar, what goals would you like to achieve or manage each day, and which activities you would like to do with your family. 
Since you want to really invest some time in your family, you have to be also okay with changing up your routine because unexpected things might happen. Do not stress too much if something in your work will not end up as you have planned. If you are still able to meet the deadline, you are okay. Try to be accurate but focus also on building flexibility in your schedule.
It is also important not to forget to take breaks - from both, work and parenting. Allow yourself to have some pleasure, take an hour or two and visit the spa, meet with your friends, do some sport, or have a drink or two in the evening. It is important not to focus only on your work/family but also on your physical and mental well being.

Although I am still quite young and I don't have much experience, I hope my suggestions may be helpful for you. I think it is quite important to have an estimate of how much time you would spend on the online work and if you want a minimum interruption for certain online tasks. As you probably already experienced, some tasks take longer than they say, and some require lots of attention. Usually, when I have an estimate, I will tell my partner the time and environment I need, so that I can effectively finish my work. Additionally, I think communication between family members on how much time a day you will spend on online working is also quite important. Since for online work, there isn't a rigid working schedule, it is easy to overwork and forget family obligations. As online workers, we are more flexible with our time and we can definitely make the schedule ourselves. Some good times to work are when family members are sleeping, or when they go out, and you would know these occations better than me. Overall, I think communications between family members about when and how to fulfill the obligations are really important. Hope you find this advice helpful!

I understand completely not only how daunting it is, but also the new skills everyone needs to pick up to enjoy a good wokr/home balance with everything.

That way you do not have work creeping into you family life, and also have a moment to focus on obligations that dont involve family. Currently I have a room that i ONLY enter while working, and its been known that no one else is to interfere with that rooms.

With mturk and related freelance sites with a work at your own pace, its very good to take breaks throughout the day to regain focus and see you family.  More radiational jobs tend to benefit more from structure, though this could all just depend on your work style and life style.

I know this for a fact because I am able to successfully get my online work done for my boss, while still making sure that all members of my family are able to talk to me or interact with me sufficiently during the course of a full workday. One of the most effective ways to balance online work and family is to set a schedule for yourself of when you start and stop working. This ensures that you will at least have a portion of the day dedicated solely to your personal life and family. It is also helpful to give yourself multiple breaks within your workday, as this allows you to not only rest your mind when needed but also be able to interact with your family if they need your help while you are working. Another good strategy is to limit how much you work. Talk to your company or boss if your family needs you more than usual. In this case, being open and letting your company know about your family’s need for you can allow them to reallocate your workload and take some weight off of your shoulders where necessary. I have personally done this when my children were ill at home and desperately needed me to be there for them. Companies are not as cold as they can appear to be and are often more than willing to make accommodations for you if you truly need them.","It is never easy balancing online work and family, but it is one of the most important and rewarding experiences that a person can have.

I would advise you to make very clear work hours, and very clear hours for family time.  Don't let your familiy interfere with your working time, and don't do any work activities during time spent with your family.  It's very hard to keep the two from colliding, when you work from home and your family is home all day.  If you don't have a quiet work space, make one. Keep a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on your ""office"" door while you're working, so your family knows not to come in and bother you.  Also, make your work time for when you're most productive and your house is the quietest.  That time for me is very early morning. By the time my family wakes up, I've already worked for 4 hours or more, uninterrupted.  So by doing little things like that, you can keep both worlds seperate, and still find quality time to spend with your family.   If you don't keep things separated, you will pull your hair out trying to get anything done. It's very frustrating when you're not organized and working in a quiet space.  It's also not fair to your employer to pay you while you're not fully paying attention.  Best of luck to you!    ","It's very important to keep your family and work life separate.

At the same time you want to be connected with your family members and for that I suggest that you share meals with them. You have to eat anyway, Why not do it together and close the door afterwards? This way you will be with your family and give attention to your online work. You can even make lunch for everybody. It's quick and easy and it is usally appreciated. Another thing that you can do is to put on some background music and when you feel that your back is tired and you need to move a little bit you can dance with your family members. They will probably like it and dancing will increase your productivity and effectiveness. Do you think you can use these ideas? ","It's not easy to reconcile online work with family obligations.

For me, I don't have any children, but I do have a partner and I always make sure to log in and spend as many hours available for my online work in the day before I am to spend scheduled time with my partner because I don't want it to interfere with our life. However, if my partner has work to do while we are together, I may just sign in and frequently check for work even if I am working on other tasks like cleaning, cooking, reading, or exercising. It really does allow for major flexibility. I think that as long as you know the times at which you need to be available each day or week for your family obligations, you can properly schedule the time you will perform your online work. You may also need to perform a bit of trial and error to see how much you can handle each week to strike a balance between spending time with your family/performing familial requirements and working to see what is best for your lifestyle. You may also need to find out what time of day and days of the week you are seeing available HITS that you are interested in and enjoy and work your schedule around that. For instance, I typically plan to have my partner spend weekends with me because I have noticed that there are rarely any HITS posted with frequency or that I want to partake in. Evenings often provide several HITS so if you need to spend time children during the day and then work at night, that is also a possibility. You have so much freedom.

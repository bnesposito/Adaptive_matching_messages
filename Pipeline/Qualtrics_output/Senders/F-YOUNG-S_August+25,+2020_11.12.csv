Being able to work in America at this time is a privilege. Another privilege is having a family to help get us through this difficult time. I believe the only way to reconcile online work and familial obligations is to be very open and transparent. That means speaking to family about how important work is during this time. Express your care and appreciation to your family and try the best you can (while also taking time for yourself to rest) to give them attention and meet family obligations. However, work comes first. Family should be able to understand and support you. Maybe instead of a big annual summer event, you have a group phone call or video chat outside of work hours. I think it is important to remember that these times will not last forever. Scheduling could also help. Utilizing a calendar or scheduling app to plan work times and shifts with quality time with family as well as obligations. This way every thing is transparent. Family is scheduled in as well as work. Just make sure to pencil in some you-time to relax and rest. I wish you all the best.","Work is certainly difficult to come by nowadays. Being able to work in America at this time is a privilege.

It can be easy to feel that your family should always come first, and while that's often the case, it's important to find a balance to ensure you can get done what you need to. I find that the best way to set boundaries is through open, clear communication. Sit your family down and express to them what you need to make sure your work is successful. Is it a certain number of hours where you can't be disturbed during the day? Maybe it's a private office space, where you can close the door and your family knows that it's important you're left alone during that time. In the same conversation, it would benefit you to also ask your family what their expectations are. Maybe they need more from you, and you need to cut back on work slightly or get better at multitasking. When it comes to family, it's all about compromise, and people understand that no matter what, you still need to work. As with any reconciliation, open and honest communication from both parties is paramount. If you can understand exactly what the needs of your family are, and they can see exactly what your working needs are, you can go from there to create a compromise that benefits both of you. I've struggled with this in the past, and I've seen how what may look like normal work to me can seem like I'm shirking other familial responsibilities. Just because someone thinks so doesn't make it so, but their feelings are just as valid, and it's imperative that you can get to a place that both parties are feeling comfortable and taken care of.","It can be difficult to balance online work when you have a family who is also demanding your attention.

Its good to take a break once in a while and attend to simple family obligations around the home. Like a 5-10 min break and go do the dishes or take out the trash. Staring at a screen all day can really harm your eyes so a nice break with some physical movement is a good step. Normally when I work I have a routine wake up at 8 a.m. and start working. I eat around 9-9:30 a.m. and feed everyone else. After that sometimes I got for a short walk around the block with my dog.I do not bring my work with me on these short little breaks. I know its not always possible to meet every need that arises while you are working but after 3 p.m. I normally switch off all work that I have been doing unless its paying extremely well.

The best advice I have is to make sure you have a room in your house where you can be devoted to working. It's best if you can be able to shut the door when you're on calls or focusing on a project intensely. Even if you can't close the door, your family should know that when you are in the room you are working and they can't come in unless they knock first or ask your permission. Encourage them to text you first so they don't accidentally walk in on one of your calls. 

If you have young kids or a partner that needs your attention often, try printing out your work calendar for them every week so they can see when you have your most important calls and blocks of time where they can't talk to you. A sign on the door that indicates when you're in a call or can't be disturbed can also be fun for little kids to check on. 

But you should also remember that just because you're working from home, you don't need to be more productive than when you were at the office. Set a hard stop time that you'll log off of work. Try to log off early whenever you can to take advantage of this great opportunity to spend more time with your family. Don't work on weekends or answer emails after hours if you can help it, it's important to set boundaries with both your work and your family.

Because you're home your family thinks you're free and available for anything; dinners, babysitting, chores. But a lot of times that simply isn't the case. Last week my brother asked me to come babysit his daughter in the middle of the workday. My girlfriend gave me some grief for not going to lunch with her. These are things I WANTED to do but simply couldn't because even though it doesn't appear like it when I'm at home with a laptop in front of the TV, but I actually am working. 

I think a good tip to handle this is to just talk to your family and make them understand your situation. Just because you're around doesn't mean you're available. Sure, there are times during a workday I can take it easy and give time to my family but when the work piles up they for the most part understand I can't be bothered. Setting boundaries like that is very important. After 5 pm I'm all yours, but before that I can't give you all of the attention that I normally would.

That was the highest paying survey I have ever come across. It took me only 20 min too!! Some fun tips: Never do any survey that pays less the average wage per hour and takes more then 4 min, Don't do surveys in general that pay little and take more than an hour of work, A good requester is Noah Turk. I have made a lot of money by him. Some of his surveys don't work though. If you just registered, remember that more surveys come after you hit the 500 or 1000 survey mark. A few more tips, don't feel discouraged if you aren't getting a ton of money in the first few days, you aren't going to get that much at all during mturk.

I am sure your work and family lives have been altered over the past few months during this pandemic. I know mine has! I am now working from home and rarely leave the house. Due to this, I have noticed that it is often hard to separate work and family, since they overlap and are occurring in the same spaces every day. The biggest thing I have learned is in order to separate the two, you need to set clear boundaries and share those with your colleagues and family. 

First, I would recommend having a dedicated workspace. Even if you don’t have an office, set aside one room for working and let everyone know that while you are in that space, you are focused on work. By setting up this workspace, it tells your mind that when you are there you are to focus on work, but also enables you to be kept alone from your family until you come out.

Additionally, try to keep as normal of a routine as possible. If you would normally get to the office around 8 and stay until 4, stay on that schedule. This keeps you from working too many hours and allows your family to know when they can see you and when you are working. Once your day is over, do not check emails or log back on, as tempting as it might be.

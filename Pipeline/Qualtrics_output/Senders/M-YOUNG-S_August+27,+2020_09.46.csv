Explain to them that your focus and complete attention is the most important part of your online work and that any distractions can be a detriment to your performance and reputation on the online working platform.

Many people seem to have a hard time with logging back on to work after they should have been finished for the day. I have been guilty of this when I have gotten emails inviting me to closed qualifications and the like. I will admit, sometimes it is worth it.

Mind you the funeral was being held some 5 states away so for most of my trip it was just driving so I was on real time crunches. I ended up getting some footage directly after all the funeral processions were over. However, this was my last night there and would be returning home at 5 in the morning the next day. I tried to put the video together on my laptop but the video editor we were required to use didn't work on my laptop. The only computer I knew it would work on was back at school.

Also, I allow them to text me a quick question regarding things that need to be addressed immediately. I discussed these requirements with my family before I started working. Also, I give them task or chores that should be completed therefore they know what I expect them to do while I am working. I usually check in with them at the beginning of the day before I start to work so I can address any situations before I am busy. 

The second thing that you must do is carve out some time to spend with your family. This time should be used to talk and bond with your family. It will allow them to feel special and let them know that they are important to you. I will usually eat dinner with them and we discuss what happened today or the current events of the world.

I think some people are under the impression that because one works at home, one can just stop anytime to attend to another's needs.  We who do this type of work know that is not the case.  You have to work when it's available.  

I have had times when a family member needed my assistance (or, more often, simply wanted it).  If it was a real emergency, I would stop working as I didn't know what else to do.  While I was sort of annoyed that I was inconvenienced through lost pay, I usually did what I felt was needed.  Other times, I would be more straightforward with the person.  I would simply tell them I had to work and didn't want to abandon that work for something trivial.  The family member got peeved a few times, but I didn't feel guilty.  She didn't understand the situation fully.  

So, my advice is to stand up for yourself.  You need to make money sometimes and can't drop everything at the drop of a hat.  I ask the person to put themselves in my shoes.  While they may not understand completely, I don't let it bother me and neither should you.","Sometimes, it is hard reconciling online work with family obligations.

When I first started online work I often worked at least ten hours a day online and then went to a second job after that for at least two or three hours a day. It was doable but it did not leave me for much time for anything else. So I started making sure I worked by a schedule and even dropped the second job to make sure I was home with my family and not leaving friends feeling like I forgot about them or was being rude.

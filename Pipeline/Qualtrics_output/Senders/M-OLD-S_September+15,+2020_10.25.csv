I would like to share a few tips have worked for me. One thing that helped me is effective organization. Use a calendar to manage your time and organize your week. Prioritize urgent, nonurgent,  important, and unimportant tasks. This has helped me because it places all tasks in a hierarchy of importance and urgency. Everything begins with a foundation of organizational structure. Another thing that has worked for me is using formal childcare services. Look for affordable childcare because it is more reliable than unpaid childcare and it will support the structure of your workweek. Another thing that has helped me achieve a work-life balance is flexibility in working hours. Ask your employer if they will work with you and allow you to work hours that best suit your family life obligations. A good employer will often work with you if you reciprocate by being a loyal valued employee. Telework from home might be an option. This frees up b time that would otherwise be spent commuting to work. It also allows caregivers to be near children or elderly parents. Increased autonomy in scheduling and working from an alternate location may help if teleworking from home is not an option. I hope some of these tips work for you.

When I spend more time playing with my kids and doing activities it has huge benefits.

A couple of pieces of advice I would share: first, make sure that your family is aware of your work obligations and that you have to dedicate time to completing online tasks each day. Write out a clear schedule (perhaps a white board in a common area) and clearly mark out the time you need to do your work. Then you can have your family members do the same. 

Let your family know that you will also mark out dedicated time to spend with them. That might be cooking meals together, reading, or watching television and movies. You could also have them work on a hobby or even start a new one. 

Then you need to do your best to stick to the schedule that everyone agrees on. You probably should find a quiet place or separate room to do your work so that you are not distracted by family members. You might want to invest in an inexpensive headset so that the noise from your online work does not distract anyone else in your family. A standing desk is a good idea, too, so that you can not spend too much time sitting. 

Finally, be easy on yourself and your family. Everyone is doing their best to cope with a strange situation.

First, a person is not likely to make a living doing this.  It will take time and experience to reach a point of making a decent amount of ""side money.""  It also takes the complete understanding of any family who may be affected by your decision to pursue it.
Open and honest discussion with your loved one(s) is the best approach.  Decide what your approach should be (2 hours a day?  4 hours a day?), set some specific goals (number of HITs per day, money earned per day), and make use of all the forums out there for help (Turker Nation, Slack).  Of course, you'll need to be open to modifying those goals as you go.
Life will help you form your ""Turking"" level of dedication; always keep communicating with your family and loved ones - they, too, will have helpful suggestions and thoughts about how to balance your new Turking efforts with the rest of life.
Sometimes you have to choose to skip a particularly inviting HIT.  Life is like that - full of difficult choices.

In many cases you are not tied to a set schedule as you would be with doing work in person, and that allows you more flexibility to accommodate family obligations. In my experiences doing online work, I would schedule my work hours to coordinate with my child's nap or independent play time when possible. And if there were any tasks that I didn't need zero distractions for (such as writing emails) I would be able to complete those while still interacting with my family. Online work has been very beneficial as far as allowing me to be with my family as I'm needed as opposed to being in an office all day. I feel like opportunity to do online work has provided me with more time to spend with my family and take care of the obligations that I have at home. The most important thing is to try to plan out your day in a way that works best for you so that you can complete your work tasks without compromising any obligations you have with your family.

I know that navigating working online, or working from home, alongside other familial obligations can be quite challenging. I believe that with the right protocols and boundaries in place, you can create a comfortable and productive work environment that will ease the challenges of working from home. First, create a set routine and schedule and stick with it. Make sure that all of your family members are aware of the routine you have in place. However, your schedule won't work if you choose to not abide by it. Consistency is key for any major change to happen. You could start by staggering each week with one additional, small change in your schedule. So in week one, you might have hour long blocks set up for you to work, and by week two, you will implement hour and a half long blocks. Additionally, making sure your family has their own schedules in place will be of great help. I find it  helpful to create a consistent morning routine that involves non-work activities. You could spend 5 minutes journaling, 20 minutes stretching or exercising, and 30 minutes eating breakfast with your family. Making sure to have family activities embedded in each day's schedule will also help create structure and boundaries for when it's time to work online. Lastly, don't be hard on yourself if you make mistakes, or lose productivity when shifting to work online. Nobody's perfect, and this transitional period of working from home is challenging for everyone!","Hi there!

We have gone through a dramatic shift between our traditional roles to one that is completely online. From traveling and having a commute, to existing in a space where the lines between family obligations and work are blurred.

My best advice, based on my own experiences, is to make the line between work and home crystal clear. As much as possible, do not set up meetings or check email past the workday. Completely disconnect. That way, you can focus on your family obligations in the morning or the evening. It is also critical to have a part of your house dedicated for ""work"" for the same reasons. 

I would also advocate for creating a daily schedule with your spouse, if you have one, if children are involved. Perhaps your spouse can tell his/her work that they are available at certain hours for face to face meetings, while you are available at a different time so someone can watch the children if needed. I would also take advantage of keeping your video off and mic off when it is possible and perhaps use a bluetooth headset so you can walk around the house to go check something out when on a call.

Good luck and remember - you will come out of this stronger, much more connected with your family, and appreciative of how life used to be!","It is hard to reconcile online work with family obligations.

Secondly, I would also say it is important to ensure you have a quiet space to yourself to work when you need it. Make sure your family understands it is not because you want to be away from them, but just so you can get your work done and then return to them.

Thirdly, try to be open and honest about your work. Keep the ones you care about involved. The more you do this, the less of a barrier there will be.

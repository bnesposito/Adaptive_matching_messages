Anticipating when your busy times will be is important.  For example, when my son is going to school, I make sure that I am relatively free at the time the bus drops him off so I'm available if there are any hiccups in that routine.  He may be coming home on a bus, but I know how things can go awry even with that routine.  And, he might come home to tell me that he needs to go purchase supplies for a school project, or maybe he's having trouble understanding a math concept.  And, don't try to be a superhero doing EVERYTHING and being successful.  Forgive your mistakes and allow the house to be cluttered for a day if necessary.  But, first and foremost, remember what is the most important to you.  Yes, you need extra money, I'm sure.  If you are working Mturk, that is all it is so find something else if you need to pay bills with it.  Still, it can be enticing when you see a period of time that multiple high paid Mturk hits come out and you might feel like putting the family stuff aside.  But, REMEMBER WHAT IS IMPORTANT.  Most people who work at home are trying to balance family with work, with an emphasis on family.  Don't lose site of that!  Let some of that work pass on by rather than neglect the ones who are most important to you.  You might feel a little regret for not making the extra money, but I guarantee that is better than the guilt you get from waking up one day and realizing you were not there for your family.

I have tried lots of different things to be successful in both of these endeavors.  I have tried telling me family between these hours pretend I am not here and do not interrupt me working.  Well, of course we all know how that goes.  I have used a daily planner and made goals for the day.  Of course those always get shifted out of place.  The issue is having me too accessible to my family versus when I am at the office working they have limited access to me. I have finally found what works best for me.  Each evening before I go to bed I make of list of things I need to get done.  Whether it is work tasks, housework, laundry, family..etc...  Then I go through my list and prioritize in order of importance and what must get done the next day.  Once that is finished, I create blocks of time for the next day in my planner and break each chunk into what needs to be done.  I create a estimate of time it will take to do each task.  I never say starting at 10 and up until lunch.  That is just creating a plan for disaster.  I spend my day with blocks of time only.  For example, I block out 8-noon for strictly work.  While I am working away I have created tasks for other family members who may be home and their tasks will keep them occupied and keep them from interrupting me while I work.  As a family, unless the house is burning down no one is allowed to interrupt my working.  We have agreed as a family that at noon- lunch time, we will regroup as a family and check in and see how everyone's day is going.  This system has drastically reduced my stress levels, I am much more organized and I feel in control of my day, instead of having my day and my family pull me in every and any direction they feel like.","I can definitely relate to the frustration of reconciling online work with family obligations.

First understand that there are two parties that have to equally appreciate what you are doing, and agree that this is doable. without family understanding that working is a way to pay for the comforts and necessities to live, and that work understands that family is the bases that uplifts you to a higher stranded to work harder so you can show them the appreciation of better living, then it'll be ok.

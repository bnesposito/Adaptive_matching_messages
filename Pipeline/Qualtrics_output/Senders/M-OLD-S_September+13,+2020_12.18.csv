A person who is working online at home has the chance to spend more time with their family and still work and earn a paycheck. The main thing to establish at the beginning is certain rules about the separation of family time and work time even though all the time is spent at home. 
     Start with setting up a certain place to work online while in your home. Make sure everyone knows when at this place you are there to work and you are not playing or surfing the web. You are working and are not to be disturbed except for very important things or emergencies.
     Next, establish a schedule. The family is used to you going to work at certain times when working away from home. Make them aware that you will be working during certain specific time periods during the day and that when you are done working online things will be just like they are on a normal work day. This schedule can be posted for all to see or you can just make a sign that you hang on the door when working and take down when you are done for the day or taking a break.
     Setting up clear boundaries between working online time and family time will make everyone more comfortable and will allow you to meet your family obligations. It eliminates the misunderstandings that result from a lack of clarity.","     Working online should be viewed as an opportunity not an ordeal.

Morally, your family is an obligation you undertook voluntarily.  As such, you need to dedicate your heart and soul to maintaining your obligations freely and cheerfully.  Never short change your family.  Your family will be with you for the rest of your life - what time, effort, sweat and treasure you invest now will bring dividends for the rest of your life.  Additionally, your job is an obligation you have undertaken purposefully.  You investigated what talents and skills you had.  You searched for a position that could use your skills and talents and was willing to pay you for these skills and talents.  You are morally obligated to give your job your best effort to fulfill the requirements of that job.

 Online work now presents a potential conflict.  Being an online worker usually presupposes that you will be working from home.  You will need to in some way isolate your self from your family so that you can focus 100% on your online job with out distractions.  I am not suggesting that you lock your self away from your family, but you need to remember that you have pledged your employer about 1/3 of your life - be dedicated to that pledge.  I am not saying that you cannot interact with your family, but devote your upmost attention to work when you are working but also devote your full attention to your family when you are not working.  Spend quality time with your family but devote your full attention to your job when you are at work.

Remote or online working will present challenges, but you are capable of both being a productive worker and being a full member of your family.  Be outstanding at both.","The most important advice I can give you is that you have sincere obligations to both your family and your job.

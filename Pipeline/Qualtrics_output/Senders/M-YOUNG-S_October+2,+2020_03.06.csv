So, maximum comfort is maximum good times with your family. You should try to do everything you can to get to the maximum comfort level at work.

In total, I spend about 3 to 4 hours doing online work a day and this schedule that I've created has never impacted me negatively. It is easy to follow this schedule and it gives me a lot of time during the day to earn, at most, $100 to $150 dollars within a month. I could comfortably earn more during the day, as I have time to do another online work session during the afternoon. But I choose not to, for my own health and because I feel like $100 to $150 a month is good enough for me. ","For me, it has been an easy task to do online work while having family obligations.

What advice I would give is to have a structured and organized schedule or plan. This way you can always balance between work and family. Obviously, the plan will not always materialize how you want it to and there will be instances where you need to be flexible. However, what goes into the planning and scheduling is also important. What I have done is let my family and loved ones around me know that I have other obligations to tend to and am not available all the time. I also let them know when I'll be regularly UNAVAILABLE due to work. I live with my family and I also let them know I can't attend to family obligations by closing the door to my room (where I work) This signals to them that I am busy and not available. Unless for emergencies, they respect it and do not bother me. So far, I have been able to keep up with both my online work and family obligations with no troubles through a detailed schedule and communication I have given to my family. I hope this helps!","Although I do not work and can not completely give my own experience of trying to reconcile online work with family obligations, I believe can still give my input because I am a college student.

For example, what I did to calm the storm between my occupation and the lack of attention I was giving to my family was bring a coworker over to my house to have a discussion with my parents about the sacrifices I was making at work. Through my coworker, I was able to settle the tension I had with my family members and make more time to work through my website where I also have Zoom meetings with colleagues. I would heavily advise to also shorten the hours of work because working for massive amounts of hours can be detrimental to family time. Maybe find a way to do both at the same time, like go to your family event while holding a Zoom meeting through your phone. Avoiding conflicts like this one are huge and can sometimes cost you your job and family's respect. Lastly, you might want to let your boss know of the problems you're having, he might help you settle some free time with family members. In conclusion, don't mix these two things together if you plan to have a functional life.","Well if you want to reconcile online work with family obligations you're going look for outside help to maybe help you out.

Sometimes you have to worry about yourself and get your work done than to focus on your family but not completely ignore them. You need a balance between the two. It is very difficult to balance between the two though. You just need to figure out the right amount for each. If your family do not support you then focus on yourself. Why should you try to help them when they never tried helping you. But if they do help you, then you should do in return. It can become a chore with family obligations. They can interfere with things that matter to you. Sometimes online work is more difficult, depending on the situation. Online work is not everything in life. Although not doing the work can ruin your future. It could be a waste of time and money if it costs something to participate in it.

It can often feel like you are being pulled in multiple directions at once. The key to success is to reframe your life in a way that your different obligations can be viewed as in harmony with one another, rather than in competition. When considering online work and family obligations, it can seem like there is not enough time in the day to accomplish goals related to both, and these two obligations are at odds. Alternatively, you can reframe how you view both so that the goals of both obligations align for one another. For example, view that your online work obligations are a necessary component of life to ensure your family is happy and healthy. Similarly, having a fulfilling family life makes it so that you have motivation and happiness that is essential to be productive at work. My best advice is for every obligation in one category, remind yourself how accomplishing that task will benefit the other. This will help to remind you of why it is important to accomplish your obligations. Finally, I would recommend taking one obligation on at a time, and not getting bogged down with the full gamut of all obligations that may lay ahead of you. Focus a whole heartedly on one job and attack it with vigor, then, upon completion, take pride in your success and acknowledge how completion helped you accomplish goals both with work and family.","In life, a common theme people struggle with is trying to balance multiple obligations.

If you have an extra/spare room in your house, it would be a very smart idea to designate that room as your office and make it clear that people should only go in there for very important matters. Set a specific time frame that lets the family know that when you're in there, you're working and they should treat you as if you're at an actual office in a place of business. Something like 9-5 or so would make the most sense, but matching it to fit the actual hours you usually work fits as well.

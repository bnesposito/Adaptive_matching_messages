I have a set amount I like to make each day along with a set amount of how many tasks I do. This allows me to have some control over what happens while staying flexible. I use a lot of tools such as Mturk suite which is very helpful for multi tasking as it is hard to stay on top of things sometimes. I have a full time job that mostly uses a computer, so online work is paired with my full time job. My goal is at least 10 dollars a day, and I think of it as making just over an extra dollar an hour for overtime. This way I do not let it interfere with my obligations when I am home. On days I get off early however I just talk to my partner about how much I have left and we normally spend time together watching something or playing on the couch while I keep it open and it gathers HITS. This way I can still multitask and my partner allows me to continue to work. I think the biggest thing is open communication and appropriate management of both time and family obligations.

Similarly to how you have a bit more of a structured day working in an office, where you're expected to arrive and leave at a certain time, apply those types of ideals to the home work environment too. 

Create an office space - it doesn't even have to be a dedicated room - just a space where you go to get your online work done specifically, and set times for when you begin and finish working. Inform your family of your space and your ideas for it, so that way they know that when you're in the space you're working and not to be bothered unless absolutely necessary. Also share your at-home work schedule with them so they know exactly when and how long you'll be at work. This gives the family, and yourself, time to get what you need done, while also allocating time to spend together when you're done with work. 

Having everyone be on the same page when it comes to expectations and time schedules is extremely important, because if we don't communicate them, how are we supposed to be respectful of each others time and work? We can't expect other people to know exactly what to do and not do if we don't set clear guides, boundaries, lessons or ideas.","My single most important piece of advise regarding this issue is setting up a timed schedule and sticking to it as MUCH as you can.

Notwithstanding this, as young adults we do find ourselves in need of cash. So the best way to go about reconciling online work with family obligations, is to reflect, strike a balance and practice better time management. Dont wait until someone call's you out like i have. Because prevention is better than cure, and remember, family obligations should come first. So it really involves looking into your priorities and acting accordingly. We may mess up trying, but be consistent with your efforts and remain morally grounded. As said, it may be difficult but, it is possible.

I'll tell you how I do it: I wake up early (before everyone) have a coffee and get ready to start my day, put a song on the headphones and start working. As I am alone I can do a large part of the tasks, and then I take small breaks during the day, whether for household chores or to clear my mind a little bit, I try to be isolated from the family while working and join them in these breaks, It is also good to do a little exercise in these breaks, even if it is for 5 minutes, just get up from the chair and start nothing difficult. I guarantee that this will help you a lot. Take time for yourself, eat well, talk to those you love. When you only live for work and only think about work you are overwhelmed and sad. You have to be fine for yourself and then be fine for work. Create goals, but don't be disappointed if you don't reach them, each day is a different day, today is not so good but tomorrow can be much better and can make up for that day.

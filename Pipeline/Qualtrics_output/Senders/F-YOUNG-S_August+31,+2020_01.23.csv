This can get even harder with online work because you are around your family while you are working, so it becomes a bit harder to separate the two. There are a few ways to work on balancing these things that I have found helpful. Firstly, I suggest claiming a space that is your own in your house. This could be your bedroom, the porch, a chair in the corner etc. Let your family members know that when you are in this space, you are working. If you have a specified space for working, it will likely be easier for you and for your family to allow you to stay focused. 
It is important to stay focused and do the best you can while working online. You should take whatever steps you can to be as focused, calm, and steady as possible when doing online work. However, it is also important to create boundaries. Decide on what your work hours are, and stick to them. If you want you can change this time every day, but once you decide work is done, it's done. Make it clear to your co-workers that you are unavailable once you are done working for the day. Working from home doesn't and should not mean you are always available. If you are firm about this, you will be able to have more time to spend on family obligations. 
One more piece of advice: don't be afraid to ask for help from other family member and friends who can spare the time. Online work can be a new and difficult experience so don't feel down if you need some extra help. ","I know that it can be really difficult to balance work obligations with family obligations.

I find that it is useful to have a designated work space in your home. This allows you to separate your home activities from your work activities even though they are transpiring in the same location. It is also helpful to have a schedule of when you will complete work activities and when you will complete home-related activities. I find that it can be overwhelming to try to do everything at once. Coming up with a schedule that set aside time for work, relaxation, household chores, and more was extremely helpful for me. I also made my work space comfortable, but not too comfortable. I used a comfortable chair and made sure not to work from my couch or bed. This helped me focus on my work, as well as put some distance between work and home, despite them sharing a location at this time. If you have other family members in your home, it is important to communicate your work schedule and any expectations you may have. For example, if you have an online meeting, communicating this with the other people in your household can ensure that they are quiet and not in the video frame, if that is your desire.","Striking a work-life balance is difficult for everyone, but even more so in this new time of working from home.

The key is to make sure you prioritize your family before work. Family is the most important thing in life and you should cherish every second you have with them because you never know when your time will be up. Of course you need a well paying job to support them and to sustain a lifestyle , but you should always make sure you make time for your family members above everything else. Your family will always be there for you and they will always support you no matter what and you cannot put a price tag on that. Therefore, my overall strategy would be to find a job that gives you flexibility or find a job that enables you to make a good enough income, but not interfere with your family life. If you end up working all the time , you will end up missing out on the most important thing in life which is your family. I would advise anybody to see happiness over trying to make the most money you possibly can. You need to be able to find the right balance and going all out for money will just end up leaving you sad and depressed after a while.","I think this problem is something that nearly everyone experiences at some point.

On one hand, you get to be at home and take the time you need to be with your family and get things done around the house. On the other hand, this could impact how efficiently you work. Other the past few months working online, I have developed a habit or strategy to my working schedule. I work 7 days a week and have a set goal depending on how much I am expecting to work and how much money I am expecting to make. I tend to work more on weekdays than on the weekends. Family obligations could definitely get in the way of work, especially of you are working online from home, but in these times of the pandemic it is a balance we are all still trying to figure out. What I do, is try to get at least some work done in the morning as an attempt to get a head start on the work day, then get lunch ready for the family. After that, I try to get as much work done as I can before it is dinner time. After dinner is when I spend most of my time with my family so I find it best to get my work done between lunch and dinner.","Working online could come with its advantages and disadvantages.

I am sure that you are trying to do your best in a challenging situation as this. I found that the best way to deal with working online is to get up very early in the morning to get a good share of my work done before anyone else is awake. This gives the opportunity to concentrate on my work without being interrupted. Then as the day goes on, if you are needed to help out or deal with family matters, you can do so without feeling guilty or concerned about getting your hours in for work.  There are always things that come up during the day that need to be addressed and dealt with. After this, I suggest a bloc of time that you can work when others are up and about, but understand that this is your time to work and not to be bothered.","Hi

This is important for everyone to respect as this is your livelihood. You can also set a bloc of time to interact with your family at a certain time of the day. It can be just as though you are at work at times and home at times this way. Structure in this way is best so that all know when it is okay to be with you and when to let you alone",0,30,gone

I find it easy to compartmentalize. When you are working, focus on work. When you are done working, focus on the family. Sometimes that might be difficult; we let family concerns distract us from our work, or we think about work when a family member is talking to us. It requires a certain amount of discipline to keep the two separate. 
This is where habit comes in. If you do something once, it becomes easier the second time. When you do it often enough it becomes second nature and you don’t even have to think about it any longer. 
When you give someone your undivided attention the will respond positively. If you haven’t been in the habit of doing that, you will, I think, be amazed at the difference it makes in interpersonal relations. Likewise, when you focus intensely on your work, you will see the quality of your work improve. The trick, to me, is developing this mental switch.
When working from home I found it necessary to train the family also. I don’t mean train like a dog, that would be insulting, but they have to understand that when you’re working you need to be left alone. Very few things need immediate attention, after all. This is habit also. Consistently is important. You can give them your full attention when you have finished whatever you’re working on.","We all have to make money to keep the household going.

First, take a deep breath. You probably feel overwhelmed, stressed, and possibly even nervous. Know that your family loves you, and you'll be able to find a balance. 
The first thing you need to figure out is what are your obligations at work, and what are your family obligations? This may change day by day, and it's okay to take it one day at a time. Make a list of things you know you need to do and have done by a certain time at work. For example, a Zoom meeting with your boss at 10 am, I call to a client at 11 am, etc. Once you have a breakdown of what your workday should look like, figure out how to schedule family obligations around that. For example, if you need to bring your grandchild to school, can you make a work call while driving home? Or can you answer work emails while your wife gets ready for the day so you have time to spend together? Thinking about ways to work around your work schedule can be most beneficial so you don't feel overwhelmed.

You would need to take time out of your day to be able to work and be able to be around your spouse and/or kids. It would be great to pick up an online work job that lets you choose your schedule so it can be flexible. In my opinion, it might be better to do work from home either early in the morning or late at night so you can have all the time to be around your spouse and/or your kids. 

However, I feel like working at night may be a downside on weekends, since that is a time many family members like to stay up and watch movies and relax. Especially since kids going to school have the weekends off and you may have a spouse that also has weekends off if they do typical 9-to-5 work. But if you think you will not care much about the interference, I would say go for it.

I'd also make sure that you have the right equipment needed, since a lot of online work jobs require headsets or a certain build in order for work to be done. I'd also make sure that you have a microphone and a webcam if you pick up a job that requires meetings or your voice to be heard.","If you want to take online work while family obligation, balance between work life and home life would be rather integral.

Firstly, I think it's very important to reflect on and evaluate your values and priorities, as well as your specific circumstances. Is your online work performance declining, improving, or stable? How about your relationships with your family members - is your work affecting them and how your family members feel about you? And what is the nature of your obligations to your family - how much of a priority is this for you, whether by your own reasoning/desires or by the control of different family members?
Especially during this time, both of these are important to many people's lives. Online work can be necessary to support your family, and being with your family likely more than you did pre-COVID, it's preferable you maintain good relationships with them. Once you can clearly define your priorities, take the appropriate actions to create a balance in your life that supports these priorities. If family is preventing you from doing well in your work, speak with them to express your concern as well as why more focus on work is important to you. If you find that work is distancing you from your family, try to come up with a strategy to manage your time better, and maybe even ask your family for help in this matter. 
It can be difficult to develop a balance when so many things are so uncertain, but I believe with careful consideration, not just on your own but also with the other people involved, you'll be able to work on reconciliation between work and home efficiently.","I likely don't have as much experience with either of these things (online work or family obligations) as you do, but I will try my best to see things from your point of view.

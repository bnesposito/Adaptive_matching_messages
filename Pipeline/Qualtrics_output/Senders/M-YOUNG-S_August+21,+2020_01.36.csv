In this day and age it is very common to work remotely/online for your job or to make extra money on the side. MTurk is an easy way to make a little extra side money to help with bills or to use on fun things. I think it is important to keep in mind that not all HITs on the website are worth your time and it will take several hours of experience to begin to recognize what is worth your time and what is not. When it comes to family obligations, I do not believe that MTurk should get in the way of these activities because it should not be used as a main source of income and it should not take precedent over family matters. Spending time with family is important and completing HITs should not come before them. 

There are plenty of ways that you can make sure you are not spending too much time completing HITs on MTurk. You can set a designated amount of time each day to work on HITs and set a timer. After the time has been met you can log off and enjoy the rest of your day with your family. Its important to set these limits for yourself so that you do not become obsessed with hitting a specific dollar amount each day. ","Dear American Women,

This may be hard in these troubling times but I can assure you it is possible. The change of many workplaces allowing coworkers to do their work online can be a good thing. But This online work can take up much of ones day, but since the work has transferred online we get a lot of time back. The problem is being able to manage the time between doing work and doing obligations of the family also. One must learn how to manage time like never before. And that managing must take into account what you value more, your online work or your family obligations. For instance, if your online work greatly benefits the family then obligations can be doing the online work. But, if the work is non beneficial, then changes may be made. The best thing one can do is find the perfect harmony of allocating ones time to the right things. Whether it be online work or family things. One shouldn't try to multitask the two. That would create problems within the two parties. So find the rhythm and the time to plan how you should approach balancing the two then all should come together.

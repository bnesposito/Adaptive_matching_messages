Also, you need to make it clear to your family that you value your time with them, but have other obligations to take your time as well. Lay out clear times that you can focus on the family obligations, and stick to it, so that they see you're true to your word. Don't be distracted by your online work when you're trying to take care of the family obligations. It will lead to a lot of stress and not being able to do either very well. You need to put your full concentration and attention onto each one at a time. Lastly, you aren't superhuman and can't do everything perfectly. Cut yourself some slack and aim to do the best that you can. But most importantly, be honest with yourself. If there's too much on your plate, see whether you can delegate some of your obligations to others in your family, or hire outside help to assist you.

Work will be there for the entirety of your lifespan, but family won't. Sometimes we can be a bit selfish and driven and just want to get ahead, but it's important to surround ourself with people who love us and aren't just also trying to get ahead. I know right now since you are young it may seen like making money and working might be the most important thing in the world, but honestly it just isn't. When we all get older, we won't be working anymore and then what do we really have. I would suggest taking time out of your day to spend time with family. Even if it's only for like an hour it's better than no time at all. You could even say that you are very low on money and because they're your family they might try to help you out. If not and you really need the money, you could take these surveys online while hanging out with your family. I do that all the time. I'll sit down with my family and split my attention between doing the surveys and spending time.

I just want to say, first and foremost, you are not alone right now. With a huge global pandemic upon us, millions of parents are finding themselves working at home with children all around them. I understand that sometimes, there can be a little pressure coming from different forces. People expect you to be a good caretaker, a hard worker, a healthy person, a family person, a successful person, and after not so long, it starts to feel like too much pressure for one person to carry. 

In terms of actually managing through this situation, I think I've had a little bit off success here. First, I like to set very clear boundaries, when I can. Work time vs family time. It's very easy to let them start to merge, and then you're not really giving either thing all of your attention at any given time. Set times to work, and then plan when family members will need to be taken care of around your major scheduling concerns. 

Beyond that, I think it's super important to manage your queue. mTurk is nice because it allows you to work when you feel like it. I find that the best time to work is during the early afternoon, so I typically plan my day around my most profitable hours. Weekends are a joke on mTurk, not worth working, so definitely take that time with your family. Work on the HITs that are going to expire quickly first, and make sure to use tools like Turkerview to figure out which HITs are actually worth doing. If you're only going to be making $5/hour, you might as well spend your time with your family. 

Overall, I understand that it can be hard. Just remember that you're not alone in this. ","Hey there,

Family members and close friends can sometimes have difficulty understanding that you may be home, but you are working and need to concentrate x amount of time. Obviously, it's good, if possible, to have a quiet room or spot away from the rest of the house, and even better if you can close the door. Let your loved ones know you'll be out periodically and can talk briefly during short breaks. Also, I'm a huge fan of multitasking.  Working from home allows you to put on something for dinner and let it cook while working; same with laundry. Helps if you view these things as 'exercise' (feel free to roll your eyes!) It helped me when I got a fitness watch. Housework or cooking breaks can be good because you're up and moving around, which is crucial to do regularly if you work at desk work.  Show your family that you're as much 'there' for them as ever! Resist the impulse to keep working, if you've put in a full day, and tend to be a workaholic! On the other hand, if everyone else is doing homework or their own thing in the evening, it's great to be able to get online and work a little bit. (But please do either enable the 'night light' feature or get blue-light blocking glasses, or you might have trouble getting to sleep.) Speaking of sleep, do try to take good care of yourself. Get enough sleep, eat well,  drink enough water, not too much coffee or alcohol. Try to get some exercise outdoors every day, or most days..  a walk or a jog can help re-align a body that's been hunching over a desk most of the day.  Have flexibility, a sense of humor, learn what works for you, and you don't have to be perfect! You'll learn what works best for you as you go.","This is a situation I can relate to very well!

I think you are asking how one goes about MANAGING their online work priorities when they have family obligations?  For that I would think that the majority of Mturk and us free lance and gig workers can relate to that.

I recently took a 6 week trip up to another state to help out my daughter with her grand kids over the summer.  they are 4 and 7 so cannot be left alone.  And i did not want to lose all of my work while watching them so i had to create a schedule for us that we all agreed on.  I worked M-W and watched them Th-Sun.  this was we both were able to get the things done we needed to get done work wise.  The family has to accept your work obligations and realize that you have to have time to do the things you need to do work wise.  The best way is to set up a schedule as you would if you were working a 9-5 anywhere else I think.

I hope this helps you!","well to be honest, i am not 100% sure what they are asking here but i will take my best shot.

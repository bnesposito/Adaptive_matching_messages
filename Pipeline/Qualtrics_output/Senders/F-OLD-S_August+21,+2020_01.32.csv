It's so easy to spend all your time either doing HITs or thinking about if you should check to see if there are any good ones available. And the more you do and less rejects, the better HITs you can qualify for. But what about the people in your life who also want you time? What about your kids who want you to play and watch TV with them? And then there's your wife who also wants and needs your attention. She may be happy you've found a way to make some cash, as the family needs that as your job isn't an essential worker and now everyone is waiting on the unemployment checks to arrive. But giving all your time to Mturk and ignoring your family is an hollow, empty exchange. Mturk will always be there.. trust me, I've been doing it for 10 years.. but family grows up, moves away, grows old. Those memories you could have made spending time with them?

If need be put your schedule on the refrigerator where everyone can see it. During these work times, you office door should be kept shut to prevent potential disturbances. Make sure you go out of your office to check on everyone as often as work will allow.",0,22,gone

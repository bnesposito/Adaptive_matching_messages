We try and get together every 5 years.  I missed the last ""reunion"" because of a baby shower in my late husband's family.  I am not close to my brother-in-law since my husband died.  When I was invited to the shower I was thrilled and had an inner need to attend to show that I still desired to be a member of the family.  However, my cousins felt that I was turning my back on the reunion and my own family.  Through discussions with my oldest cousin, I got her to understand my situation and she was able to share this information with everyone else at the reunion.  I had to take a long weekend away from my online work, but family ties were more important at that time.  Hopefully I will be able to see all my cousins at the next reunion.","While online work may be helping to support you, family obligations never stop, no matter what is going on.

Working online can be very beneficial -- in fact, I wouldn't have it any other way. The most important thing is setting boundaries with your family members. They must be made to know that when you are working, you are working and should not be disturbed unless something vital or drastic comes up. 

My worktime has been flexible. I get up hours before anyone else in the home so that I can work uninterrupted. At other times in my life I stayed up all night to have the office to myself. Creating a workspace in a quiet place in your home is very beneficial. Organizing housework and shopping so as to maximize the time you spend uninterrupted is essential, especially if you have no help with such things.

So much depends on your family situation, such as the ages of your children, whether you have a spouse at home, and if your children are old enough to take care of responsibilities such as cooking and cleaning. Having a spouse willing to help with family obligations is a wonderful thing, but not essential.  With cooperation from your family members it can all run very smoothly. 

If you have babies or very young children, you might have to bring in outside help. But I had three children under the age of three for two years (surprise twins!) and I managed well to work online with very little help from my spouse by simply trading sleep for time to work. It wasn't an ideal situation, but I managed. 
I wish you well with your endeavors!","I've been reconciling online work with family obligations for more than 20 years.

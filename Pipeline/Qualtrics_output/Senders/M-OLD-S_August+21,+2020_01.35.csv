Of course, we know this is not a perfect world and some people may forget you are working or think a circumstance may be more important than it actually is.  Provide feedback to whoever interrupted you how it may have been better handled.  Good communication between you and your family is crucial.
I also ask my family to let me know ahead of time if a family obligation has arisen.  Please give me enough time that the obligation may be rescheduled if necessary.  As an example, my wife called to make a doctor's appointment that I would need to accompany her to.  She knows that I prefer mid to late afternoon appointments and makes every effort to schedule in that window.  Occasionally that is not possible and she will clear it with me just after the appointment is made.","When working at home I make it clear with my family members that I am not available unless it is urgent.

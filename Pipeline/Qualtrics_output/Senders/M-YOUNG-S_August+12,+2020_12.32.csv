It's something that I still struggle with. For instance, I work a day job, but I also spend 4 or 5 hours a day doing online work as well. I am married, and I have a 3 year old daughter as well. Luckily with my regular job, I work different hours and work mostly before anyone else has woken up yet. By the time I come home, my wife is always happy to have me home, because we have a toddler and she's a handful, and my daughter is happy to have me home, because she loves attention. My wife wanted to be able to stay home with our daughter and so I knew I would work more to make sure that was able to happen. I only have so many hours in a day. And again, finding the right balance is hard. What I have found works, is that I mostly work where my daughter and wife can get to me. I don't close myself off unless I'm doing something that requires that usually. I try to be flexible. I also try to do the majority of my work while my wife and daughter are out, sleeping, or doing other things. That way my work isn't cutting into my family time as much. We have set hours where I don't work as well. You know, we make sure we eat meals together as a family, and I always am willing to drop what I'm doing to help my wife get dinner ready, or any other amounts of things done. Flexibility is my main key to balancing the responsibilities. But I've found that for the most part, online work is the easier thing to be flexible with. So I put my family first, and work my online work around it. Talk to your family about what they want and expect from you, and work around your online work from there.

How are you supposed to focus on the Zoom conference when you have an eight-year-old running around the house?! Well, it's a little more tricky than many people originally thought, but balancing online work and family obligations is not as difficult as you may have first expected.

The first thing you need to understand is that you have to be mindful of your time. This is the most important factor! If you are working, you are 100% working, not parenting. If you are parenting, you are not working. Not only will this help you to compartmentalize each aspect of your life, but you'll also be able to give more of an effort to each individual task. You'll become a better worker and a better parent.

Second, try to stick to a schedule, but not too much. Interruptions always occur and with today's uncertainty, you need to be prepared to react to things that are beyond your control.

Finally, in order to better reconcile online work with family obligations, you need to sometimes put yourself first. Your mental health should be one of your top priorities, since you can neither be a productive worker or good family man if you are depressed. Take some time for self-care throughout the day to do the things you enjoy without feeling guilty about them.

I'll leave you with one last note: be honest and communicate with your family. Let them know about your struggles and issues; they can help! Good luck, and I hope you can find the perfect work-life balance!","There is no way around it: working from home may cause serious turmoil when it comes to family obligations.

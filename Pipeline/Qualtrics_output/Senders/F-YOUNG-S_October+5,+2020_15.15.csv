My advice to you is that it is important to have an even balance in life. With work becoming virtual, we must overcome some obstacles we have not yet encountered in life. One example of this being family obligations. When an issue like this arises I can say from past experience that it is okay to change your schedule. There are some things in life we cannot miss out on and it would be okay to change work. For example, a funeral, important birthday, or important family reunion. However, there are also situations that are not as serious and should not get in the way of work. When making these decisions it is important for us to realize how these decisions will later impact us. We should not just put off work because it is easier for us to do so. When these obstacles arise we must think of what is best for us overall. If that means we have to miss out on a family obligation, then that may be the case. It is always important to look at these issues from new perspectives to gain insight on what is most important to us and what will benefit us most in the long run of life. ","Hello,

From my personal experience working from home with family obligations at the beginning is really difficult especially if you have small children, however as time goes by you will start to adjust and become more comfortable in organizing your time. 

One of the things that I do to make sure that i meet my weekly work requirements is that i set daily tasks and goals. In between work i do recommend that you take a lunch break and several breaks in between. for example, if you work a nine to five job i recommend you set aside one hour of lunch and at least 15 minutes every hour to get a drink of water or to stretch your legs.

If you never worked from home asked your supervisor to give you weekly tasks for at least the first two weeks until you get the hang of working remotely. You can always research other tips to be a successful remote worker.

Since you can't elaborate for me, I'll do my best... 

If you live with other family members who are home at the same time, working from home can be an opportunity to spend more time with them. However, you have to make sure that others are clear on your boundaries and the fact that you do need to work at some point. Don't let them ask you to do chores all day long if you have an afternoon deadline on a work assignment, for example. 

Also be clear on how much noise you can tolerate. If you can work in a buzzing environment, that's great, but if not, make sure your family members know this so they keep it down. 

You'll also need to have discipline yourself. You can't blame your family members alone if you waste your entire day talking or watching TV with them and miss work you had to do. Be responsible. 

As a final note, if your family members are working from home as well, make sure you respect *their* boundaries as well.

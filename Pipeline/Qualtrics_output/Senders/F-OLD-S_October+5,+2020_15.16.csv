All family members need to understand the space is reserved just for you to do your work. So what I'm saying is you are setting a boundary with regard to your working space. But it's also important to establish boundaries with your time. Whatever works for you you can choose a designated time and be certain to work exclusively during those hours. Or if you prefer you can post your hours allowing yourself some leeway. It's important that family members check those posted hours so they'll know when you're available for them when you are exclusively working. Since time is short my third key point part and take away be gentle with yourself. None of this is written in stone so if you lose the side of the goals periodically, just reset them!

I initially found it difficult to balance working in the home with managing my home life. Over time, I have found remote work to be extremely beneficial to my work life balance. I am able to be present in the home which enables me to interact with my family on a more casual, more frequent basis than in the forced, hurried manner we interacted when I worked out of the home. My family has also been able to experience me doing my work and has a better understanding of what I do and how I interact with others, allowing me to be a role model to them. It has also allowed me to be more flexible with my schedule rather than only working within a rigid work schedule. If I need more flexibility within the normal working hours, I can take that time knowing I can easily get back to my work without having to leave the house. I can enjoy meals with my family and save time by not having to drive to and from work each day.","Having to pivot to remote work very quickly approximately 7 months ago was a significant transition for me and my family.

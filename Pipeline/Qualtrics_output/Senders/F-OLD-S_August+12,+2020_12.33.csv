If you freelance, set a dedicated work schedule to do work only and nothing else. Once you are finished working put it away and don't go back to it until the next scheduled time that you have set.

It helps to also set a schedule for family time or obligations. I think that prioritizing and being organized by using a schedule is a sucessful way to reconcile work and family obligations. This is the method that has worked best for me. 

When it's work time that is what you do, you work. When it is family time then that is what you do you spend time with family. 

People think that working online is a breeze but it takes a lot of self disipline and organization. I think it works best to have a dedicated room that you work in and when you're done for the day, you shut the door and walk away until the next day. It can be very challenging to work online at home but if done right it can be very rewarding.","I have found that the best way to reconcile online work and family obligations is to treat working online like you would a regular out of home job.

The first thing that I do is choose my time to work when the rest of my family is otherwise occupied. I wait to start until I have prepared breakfast and gotten everyone settled into their day. This makes working from home much more doable. 

The second piece of advice that I would share is that the person who works from home must be able to switch tasks without a lot of difficulty. Let's face it, emergencies happen that the person working from home must deal with and being able to switch what you are doing is important.

 Probably the most important factor that makes up a successful online worker is patience and a positive attitude. Things go awry, and its best to not be too hard on yourself when they do. You will have good days and some that are not so good but overall things generally work out. I enjoy my online work even with the interruptions and dealing with family drama. Overall it has been a positive experience for me and one I plan to continue to engage in.","I would say that there are several things to consider when working from home and taking care of family obligations.

Make a room your office and explain that it is off limits.Maybe have your office far away from activity that goes on in the house.  Like I said it will take time to get use to it.  Put a sign on your door telling family that you are working.  I rewarded my kids with something special like making cookies or doing art projects. Spending quality time with them is a plus. I also find me time when everyone is content because that gives me the patience for the next day. Also a good night's sleep.

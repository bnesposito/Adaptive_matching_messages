If your kids go to school during the day and your spouse goes to work then you should work while they are away and treat the hours like a normal job. If you have young children who are not in school yet work when they are interested in their television program you put on for them or while they are taking naps. Ask your spouse to look after the kids for a couple hours in the evenings and work during those hours. Also put your children to bed around 8 and work from 8 until 10 to get some extra time to yourself. Make sure you remember that the amount of time put in greatly correlates to the growth in your efficiency on the platform. Hitting the major mile stones of 1k, 5k, and 10k hits opens up opportunities to make more money in less time so it is important to maximize the amount of time in the beginning to make it an efficient money maker later down the road. And always remember most timers for hits are longer than the hit takes so you can accept a hit and finish helping your kid with something before starting the hit and running out of time. Requesters give us this cushion so we can have multiple hits in our queue at one time.","The best way to work online while still maintaining the family balance is to find the best times to work during the day.

I know for myself I've definitely been able to get stuff off the ""check-list"" done solely based on the fact that I've physically been at home when things have occurred to me, and it is easy to steal away a few minutes to get those quick tasks done.

Due to the pandemic, a lot of people who usually worked in an office are now working from home and trying to deal with the disruptions and distractions that come with being in the household and with their partners and children. I think the best thing to do is try to set up an ""office"" in your home that is dedicated to work and only work. This means that family members would all know that the office is off-limits, and that even though you are home, you are still at work and are not to be disturbed until the end of the work day. 
I personally have worked from home since before the pandemic, so I am used to having to try to balance work with family obligations, and it hasn't always been easy. My family would ask me for favors throughout the day because they knew I was home. I had to gently remind them that while my location is at home, my mind is at work, and I must crack down and focus on my job responsibilities until the work day ends, other than the occasional midday break.

I've found that the best way to handle online work with family obligations is to sit yourself down and take a good look at everything you need to get done throughout the week. How much time do you need online every day? How much time do you need to complete family obligations? What times throughout they day do you usually complete those things?

Online work is appealing because it can be done at any hour of the day, but making sure you are still committed to family obligations is important. This may mean making a schedule that mimics a normal work day so your hours align with your family obligations. In addition, this may also mean keeping odd hours if your family obligations are during the day. The most important thing is to not feel guilty about your work or your family obligations. It can seem overwhelming at first, but getting into a routine helps. Additionally, it is important to remember that although your online work may be non-traditional, your work is still valuable and you should never feel like your online work isn't important. Finally, I suggest making a list of your family obligations to give you a little inspiration you can look at while you are doing your online work.

Then once work is over, shift your priority to your family and spending time with them. If you can, try not to focus too much on work and focus instead on your family and what they need.

 I am a college student living at home with my parents, and for something like online school, which can be done at any time of the day, it can be a little harder to manage my time. 11:59 pm deadlines make it tempting to do school work in the evenings rather than during the day. In order to battle this, I try my best to set a time limit for when I stop doing work. Usually for me it is around 8:00 pm, when my parents are also finished with their work. I set aside all of my textbooks and assignments and spend time with my family, trying not to think too much about school deadlines. If, for any reason, I desperately need to finish an assignment and must ignore my family obligations, I try to make it up to them another day.

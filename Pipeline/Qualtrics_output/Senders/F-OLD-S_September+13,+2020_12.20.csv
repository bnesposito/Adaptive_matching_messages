When my company switched to remote working I was so worried. How am I going to work with so many distractions such as kids and dogs around. I have come up with a routine. I start working online at 6am before many people in my household are awake. When my family arises, I take a break and make breakfast. I always take lunch around the same time. My family knows what time then to expect lunch. In the mid afternoon, I start cooking dinner. It works out because the dinner will be cooking while I am working online. Usually I try and finish my work by 5:30pm. Dinner will be ready and I can spend more time with the family. I have found this routine to be very helpful and less stressful on myself and family. If you create your own routine and stick to it, I believe you will be successful at working online. Once you get a handle on your routine, you can add some things in, such as taking a walk outside during your lunch break. I find the walk very relaxing.","Since the pandemic started, working in the office has been put on hold by so many companies. When my company switched to remote working I was so worried.

Working on line from home ought to be somewhat the same.  ?There is a real advantage because you can be somewhat flexible.  But you need a schedule so you can get your work done.
Figure out when your family needs your help least.  That may be early in the morning or in the evening.  With some luck, it could be midday.  Also figure out when your online work in the most demanding. Write  down these times for both schedules on columns. Find times where the obligations do not overlap. That is the beginning of a schedule for you. You need to sit down with your family and work on this schedule so that everyone understands that there are certain times of the day that you need to work and that, barring an emergency, the family needs to amuse themselves during these times.

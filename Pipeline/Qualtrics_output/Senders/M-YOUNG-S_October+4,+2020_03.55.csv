The first rule that my wife and I have is that we both shut down our computer at 5:00 unless there is a very important task that is time sensitive and needs to be accomplished right away. Other than that, we always shut down on time to be able to transition to spending time together. After we turn off our work computers for the day, we usually go for a walk around our neighborhood together to hear about each other's day and any other topic we want to discuss. This allows us to spend uninterrupted time together where we can talk and transition from work into our family time together. For us, it always important to remember that family comes first, followed by work. Careers and jobs change throughout our lives, but we have made a commitment to each other that our family will last forever. This helps to remind me that family is my first priority and no job or career is worth taking away from that priority. We are also very intentional about scheduling plans and activities for the weekends where we spend time together as a family. We feel that if we don't make these plans that sometimes we will feel guilty about not doing anything and sometimes feel obligated to fill that time with work. Planning these family activities help us to ensure we are spending time together and not focusing on work.","In this season, it has much harder to balance online work or working from home with my family obligations.

Understand that there is not a one size fits all schedule and you are unique in your situation. Find a time everyday to block off to do online work that does not interfere with family obligations. This could be first thing in the morning before anyone else is awake, or during the afternoon when children are napping or even late at night once everyone else has gone to bed. Take the time to really think when the best time for you would be and block off that time everyday. Planning ahead of time will allow you to take the stress of trying to figure out everyday when you will fit in your online work and will eliminate decision fatigue. Another important factor to remember is to be kind to yourself throughout the process of reconciling online work. You will miss days of work and sometimes wont even feel like working at all due to family obligations and that's ok.

In my experience letting your family know that your screen time is also your work time makes people more willing to lend a hand with other household obligations or at the very least less likely to disturb you for anything short of an emergency. Online work may not be the best paying gig there is but at least it is flexible enough to allow you to decide when you can work and when you would rather not or simply can not. 
Work of this nature is the true definition of a side hustle in the sense that it is what you make of it, it may help you pay that extra bill that creeped on you last minute or it can be ""fun money""

In my country one just has to work. It tends to carry more weight. Often this is a hard calculus and may be one of the few times in life that major choices can make use of gut feelings as to satisfaction. Dissatisfaction likely means that one side of the balance is out of whack.
Remembering that this balance is always going to be in flux and it will gradually, inevitably need tweaking, is not in itself a cause for dismay. It is just a signal that one is not happy with the amount of time that work or life is getting. In this modern life we often here that ""there just isn't enough tie to do everything"". Surprise, that is absolutely right! This when prioritization is important. One doesn't have to do everything. We actually do a lot of things that are ultimately time wasters and are meaningless. Ridding clutter in activities is like cleaning the house. Everything gets more simple. How's that for off the cuff?

While probably not meaning to interfere in your work, the fact that you are at home may give them the perception that it is ok to just ask a quick question or to help them quickly with some problem that they may need help with.  While initially this may seem like a small thing, if you are living with multiple family members and they all have this same perception, your day can often be filled with many interruptions and distractions making it difficult to concentrate and focus on the work at hand.

My advice on how best to handle this if possible, would be to work in a separate room where you can have privacy from the rest of the family members and to politely yet firmly tell them that while you are in this room, you are not to be bothered with non-emergency issues.  Tell them that you will have scheduled breaks at certain times throughout the day and that if they need help with certain issues to wait for those break times rather than interrupt you while you are in the room working.","One of the challenges of working online from home if you have a family is the perception that members of your family might have that you are available to interact with them throughout the day even though you are working.

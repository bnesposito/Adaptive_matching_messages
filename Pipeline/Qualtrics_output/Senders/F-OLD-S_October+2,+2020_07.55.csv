A written schedule can be posted for family members who are able to read, and a pictorial symbol can be created for members too young to read. A room with a door is preferable, and one that has a method of locking it. The temptation is too great to treat a person in the same manner as they usually do during after work hours or days off, so it must be made perfectly clear that you are working and are unavailable. Incentives may be needed for young children. Perhaps playing with them during a break. Texting should be allowed, but a limit as to the number and length of the messages should be established and strongly adhered to. Perhaps children can be invited into your workspace when you are performing something that does not require much attention, or are waiting for a meeting to start.

In my own experience, I have been interrupted at the worst times, and it has made it difficult for me to continue what I was working on. Sometimes you can't step away. I have found it is best to plan ahead, letting the people I live with know, that I will be busy and unavailable for a small increment of time. It may be inconvenient at times, especially when you're in the work zone, but you will need to step away, take a break and see what the rest of the household is up to, before you start a new work assignment/task. It is not a perfect solution, but for me, since I've had to stay and work from home because of the coronavirus shutdown, it is the only way I can get anything done, especially since I live with elderly parents. There will be times when they forget and interrupt me in the middle of an important task, and it takes everything I have not to be upset with them.

While both are important you have to weight the circumstance with the trade off. If you are obligated to an online job for certain hours of the day then your family obligations need to be scheduled around that time as much as possible because you made a commitment to be there for your employer. If your work online has a flexible schedule then of course there is more ability to work your family obligations in and around your work. If the latter is the case, then I think it is important to set goals. Allow yourself a set time for family and a set time for work each day or week. Just like you would schedule a meeting you can schedule family time. That way your family will know when you are focused on work but they will also know that there will be a set time for them. This will hopefully help them feel like you are considering them just as important as your work and also cut down on interruptions while at work. In addition, by setting aside certain family time you will hopefully feel less guilty during the times you are working because you have made a conscious decision about your time that includes both work and family.","Working online and also being committed to family obligations is a delicate balance.

You don't have to commute anywhere and your wardrobe can consist of pajamas (if you're not using Zoom or any other place where they can see you). You can be at home for your kids if you have any, and you can keep an eye on them by taking a break now and then to check on them. I like working at home because I basically set my own hours and work throughout the entire day. Since I have no kids, I can work nonstop if I want to and with my type of work, I can work up until the middle of the night if I need or want to. I also save money by not having to buy gas as much or having to pay to eat out at a restaurant or fast food establishment. 

I am trying to think of some reason why I would not want to work at home, and the only thing is I don't see other people that much or have a personal connection with them as you would if you were in an office. I think sometimes you may miss the interaction with people outside of your family to just talk about things.

However, I think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages.","Working from home is definitely worth it.

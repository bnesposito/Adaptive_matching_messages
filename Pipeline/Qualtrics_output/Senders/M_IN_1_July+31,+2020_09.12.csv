This is also true for her children, who must adapt to changed circumstances and perhaps play a different role within the family as a consequence. Sustaining work and care over time means that the situation of being a working family must become part of the everyday and regular practice of the family, and this actively involves all family members. This article explores this concept of a ‘family-work project’ through a qualitative longitudinal study of British lone mothers and their children, starting as the mothers took up work and following the families for four to five years. The research captured the experiences of the families as they negotiated the demands of sustaining employment while living on a low, but complex, income.
How people manage care and work in everyday family life is both a personal and a political issue.It is a personal issue that we all face, and must find answers to, throughout our lifetimes. It is a political issue that underpins much of state provision, both cash and services, and the answers that governments construct in policy profoundly affect the opportunities and choices for individuals. It is a gendered issue, in that women continue to take more responsibility for providing family care, whether for young or old, than men. It is a social class issue as inequalities in income, resources, and autonomy at work act to limit, or to extend, options. The need to balance work and care is greater at certain stages of the life-course, in particular when caring for children and for elderly parents, and can be particularly problematic for some family types, including lone parents.","When a mother starts work, her daily life changes in various ways: time, money, relationships, quality of life, and well-being are all subject to modification and potentially greater uncertainty.

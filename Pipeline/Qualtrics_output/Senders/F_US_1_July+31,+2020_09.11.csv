This allows me some time to focus on my work without interruptions. 

You can also try to set up some time in the middle of the day or the evening where it is accepted that you need to focus. I have found that sometimes this time needs to vary, depending on the day and what else needs to get done, but I have an understanding with my family that I need some alone time to focus on work and make money. If you make them aware of this time ahead of time, they have time to ask you for what they need first. It also draws a line of respect.

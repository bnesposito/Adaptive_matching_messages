Just as you separate a physical in-person job from home, you need to have boundaries between online work and your home life.

For instance, if you drive to work at the same time every day and stay at your place of work for a set amount every day, you have a schedule. And you and your family knows that when you are at work, you need to stay focused on your job. Likewise, when you come home, you need to be able to let your work-related duties and obligations stay behind so that you can focus on family obligations at home.

That work-life balance can and should be present with online work, as well. It is necessary for you to separate your work and home life so that you don’t lead to burnout and your family doesn’t feel neglected. 

To do this, simply set boundaries with your online work. Set up a daily routine, just like a physical work schedule, to commit to your online work. When it is time to quit work for the day - quit. Step away from your online work and commit the rest of your time to your family. It may even help to have an office dedicated to your work. When you are in the office during your scheduled work times, your family will know that it is time for you to be working online and to be left alone.","In order to reconcile your work with family obligations, the most important thing you have to remember is that even though it is online and can be done from home, work is work.

Use this meeting to discuss family values. Do your family members value solitude? Or do they prefer social interactions on a regularly scheduled basis? To facilitate this conversation effectively, you may want to to talk about love languages. Some love languages can include acts of care, or gift giving, or words of affirmation, and many more. This can help guide the discussion as you ask each family member: Which love languages do they prefer to receive? Which do they prefer to give? Once you have a general idea from each of your family members, open up the discussion to a practical and honest evaluation of your available time. You can even set up a family-shared Google calendar so everyone can see which blocks of time you need to work, and which blocks of time you might be available for family activities. This way, they can have clear communication about your limitations and availability. Even better, they can add in their own scheduled events and you can even join them in any activities that they choose to initiate! Good luck, and may the discussion go well for you and your loved ones.","In order to reconcile family obligations and online work, you can start off on the right direction by having a sit down meeting.

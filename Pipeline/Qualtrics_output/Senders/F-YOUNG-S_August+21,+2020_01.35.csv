In times like these, when more people are working from home, it is good to have balance a healthy balance between the two just as one does when working remotely. It's especially critical that one does not neglect family time because of too much work, especially when others, such as kids are dependent on you for socialization time. However, that's not to say that one should cut down too much on working, which could jeopardize one's financial situation, making the situation even worse. I think that helpful thing to do in such cases, is to have a talk with family about how much time one is planning on working and when one will have, if any, breaks during the day. This way the family can anticipate when is a good time to talk and spend time whit you. ","Work and family matters are both important aspects of one.

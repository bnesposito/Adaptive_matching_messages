I have been working from home even before COVID-19 to take care of my elderly mother. She does not understand how anyone can earn a living staying at home. She thinks my work must not be very important. I have tried for months to explain to her that in some ways working from home is harder than traditional 9 to 5 job. I have to fight for jobs, which are generally low-paying. There is often a time limit which produces stress. My mother would talk to me during these stressful times. I would respond in a loud voice to be quiet, and she would get upset. She says I am so mean. I ask her, would she bother me while I'm working in an office? No, she answers. I explain working at home is just like working in an office. I ask her to respect my work space and time. I know when I have to stop work to take her blood pressure and give her the medications. I know the chores I have to do because she can't do them. Just give me some room to arrange when I do them. Work is important. Money is important. Everything is secondary unless there is a major emergency. She still doesn't like it, but now she compromises, although reluctantly.","I can completely relate to this problem.

That is, time must be set apart for one that must not be allowed to overlap with the other.  Easy, of course, when one must leave one's home to work, but when working at home this can be challenging.  My suggestion would be to sit down with your family, including your children, and take time to help them understand that you won't be available to them while working.  As charming as it might be to have your children interrupt your work, especially during an online meeting, it really does take time--more time than you actually have--to return your focus to your work.

Also, be sure to arrange your work area such that distractions of any kind are minimized.  Make it clear, to yourself and anyone who sees your workspace, that this space is, in fact, for work, and nothing else.  The space itself and how you arrange it will give your family important visual cues that you are ""at work"" and must not be disturbed.  Even better, try to make sure your space has a door that you can shut.  And don't forget the DO NOT DISTURB sign.","I would say that the most important thing, which you no doubt already realize, is that the two must be kept separate.

Too many people make their jobs their highest priority most of their adult lives and end up missing out on many wonderful experiences with their family. So, I would recommend that you remind your family regularly how much you love them and how you will always be there for them. Then I would recommend that you proceed to set some expectations and boundaries. You will probably want to set up a home office in its own room with a door you can close. You should then let your family know what hours you will be working daily and ask them to respect those hours so that you can get your work done as efficiently as possible. Explain to them (especially your children) that the more you are allowed to focus on your work, the quicker you will be done for the day, ans thus the quicker that you will be able to wrap your work up for the day and spend time with them. Either way make sure you have your priorities straight. The older you get, the more you will realize that life is short...you owe it to yourself and your family to make the most of it. I wish you well!","Well young man, the first thing I would say to you is to remember that work a job is mostly  means to an end, and that your family should always come first.

These days we are all being asked to do more and more in terms of our work obligations and the technology is there to keep us connected 24 hours a day. This can easily conflict with the time that we have traditionally spent with our families in a previously undisturbed way. It is important to draw a line between work and time that is to be spent outside work in a way that makes a solid delineation. One technique for doing this is to set aside space for work if you are working at home and only use that space for work. One can then officially start working when they enter the space and then move into family time when they leave the space. This is a good technique that anyone can use to help draw important distinctions between work and family time. In this way, when the two are initially separated it provides rest and relaxation away from work which in turn serves to further the goals of work by making us more prepared for work.

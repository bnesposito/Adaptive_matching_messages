You should remember that your home life is more important than your work life and it should be given a higher priority.

Does the availability of online work change during certain days or hours? Find a happy medium. Try to regiment them both, within reason. Neither, especially your family obligations, can be fully regimented, but taking a step in the right direction on an organizational level will aid your productivity and decrease your stress or disappointment when a conflict arises.

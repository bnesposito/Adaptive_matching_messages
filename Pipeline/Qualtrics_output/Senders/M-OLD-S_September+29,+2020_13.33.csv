I have completed over 5,000 MTurk HITs over the past few years. This has given me some insight into balancing the work with other obligations I can share with you. First, don't become fixated on earning a set amount each day or week. Some days will be great, others will be awful. Second, involve your family. Set up a HIT-catching script. I use Panda Crazy. It sounds an alarm when it places a HIT in your queue. Tell your family what to listen for and to alert you if they hear it from your computer and you do not. Third, don't sit at your computer all day. Leave it, interact with your family. You should have the HIT catcher working and you can temporarily leave what you are doing and work on MTurk for 10 minutes. Try to keep a balance between time in front of the screen and the rest of your life. The tool I described can help you with this process. Good luck and most of all, have fun.","Hi.

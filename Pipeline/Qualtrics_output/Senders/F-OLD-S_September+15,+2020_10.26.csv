Most families are average size of a married couple and two children. The first and foremost challenge is sharing time with family and devoting quality time to good work online that is usually performed at home.
At home most families have a dedicated office space for the computer, internet hardware, and printer. However, the family will want to share this space and the computer and hardware.
This is the major problem. Time share must be scheduled in order for the quality work to be performed and family to have access to the computer.  If the work is not done, the job is not done, and the job may be lost with no income coming into the household.  Therefore, the family has to be told straight forward and must understand the importance of the online work is #1 priority.
Then the computer must monitored and limited use for security as the computer must not be harmed or broken.
As far as family time without online work that is most likely done at home, this is a major problem that arises. It is hard to divide work and family time when working at home because work is always a step away from and around the house.  Phone calls, emergency work requests, and etc. Therefore, a person must schedule as much as they can family time away from work.

The first step is to record the time you work online for about a week.

For instance, they may treasure a half hour in the morning to eat and talk with you before they start their day.  Also, they might value having dinner with you and spending the last hour of their day relaxing with you while watching TV.  I've found that planning the time for family first and then scheduling work around it to be the easiest and most effective method of balancing the two.  You'll also tend to feel more rewarded for your time spent on both because you and your family will be aware of the times you've specified for them specifically.  While you work, you won't feel guilty that you are neglecting your family.  You also will not feel rushed in your work, which will lead to greater satisfaction.

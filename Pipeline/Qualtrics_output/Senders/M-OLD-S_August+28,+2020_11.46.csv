To successfully balance family obligations and online work I think it is essential to set aside time when you can concentrate on the work without distractions. If possible, you could even go outside the home to perform the work. Places like the library or a cafe are good places to go to get away from home distractions and interruptions. 
Leaving home to work may not be possible for people who are caregivers to children or others. In this case, setting rules and boundaries with the other members in your household can work. You can schedule blocks of time when you are not to be interrupted. Ideally you would have a separate room to do your work.

The main disadvantage to working online from home is that family obligations can completely overwhelm your work. By completing consuming your time, family obligations can lower productivity. In turn, lower productivity lowers your income. In turn, a lower income makes providing for your family obligations more difficult because you are now forced to work many more hours.

I have a feeling that anyone who is ""working online"" is some entitled housewife who, while her husband is at a real job earning the actual family income, she's ""working online"" as an excuse to not clean the house or prepare meals. She can't make lunch for the kids to take to school because she's ""busy with my online work"".

I feel legitimately sorry for kids growing up in a house where one, or both, of their parents ""work online"" and can't manage to properly care for them to the point where they have to wander up to some stranger on the street and ask them for advice on how to reconcile online work with family obligations.

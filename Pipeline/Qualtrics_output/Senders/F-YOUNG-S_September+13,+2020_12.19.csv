Set aside a certain amount of time each day for work and then make sure to stick to that time. It is okay to give yourself breaks during the working time, but make sure to not mix the two different obligations together at the same time. During this working time, only focus on work to help reduce distractions and work efficiently, making the most of the time set aside for work. Once that time is up, focus on family obligations. After work is over, do not worry about checking work emails, following up on work, or anything else that would take away from family obligations and put more time in than what was set aside for work.
An example of using this advice could be to start online work at 9am and set a timer for, say, 2 hours. Remember to only focus on work during this time. Once the 2 hours is up, take a break for 15 minutes. Focus on any family obligations that need to be taken care of and then go back to work. Continue to break up the day between work and family obligations as needed but once the work day is done, do not focus on work again until the next day.

I personally have also gone on to make a list of things that matter to me the most and things I won't compromise for. For example grieving days (like funerals) for people in my immediate family.

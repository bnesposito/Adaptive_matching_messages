Online work can actually sometimes be beneficial because you get to work from home and you are already home with your family in the first place anyways. You don't have to go anywhere and the family is already with you in the same place. That means if they ask for help on anything that means you are already there with them in general. The family time can always come after you set the work schedule for yourself and then the work of the house can happen afterwards. The timings between the two can be sometimes quite hard but you have to find a way to actually make that work. I do the same type of work online and what I do is that I set up my work schedules first and then I have to find time for the house and family work afterwards and keep everything organized into the correct timings.

If your job has set hours, fight the urge to work after hours. For example, after 5:15 I shut off my work computer for the day and do not check my email, and devote the evening to family tasks only. On the flip side, from 8:30 am to 5:15 pm I am only doing work tasks. This separation really helps me to be able to focus better at work and on my family. Another big thing that has helped is setting up a real work from home desk that is not in my bedroom or dining room. Having a designated space that is just for work helps me to be able to distance myself from work in the evenings and on the weekends. Finally, I would say the biggest hurdle is to work on telling yourself that it is okay to try different things and see what works for you. Right now balancing work and family can be so difficult, but there are ways that can help make it much less stressful if you put the effort into trying things and finding what works for you.

You need to make money and sometimes others may be dependent on you to do so, but if you spend too much time doing that, family and loved ones may start to see you as a stranger or someone that only wants to be left alone even if that is far from the truth. I spend a great deal of my time doing online work because I desperately need the money, but it's important to do everything in my power to make time for family too.
My advice would be to set a solid schedule for when you need to work and when you can stop for a while. I would suggest only working for about two hours at a time. You can have multiple blocks throughout the day that you set aside for online work, but keeping them rather short will make sure that you still have time for family in between. I'd also suggest being a little flexible if you have to. Maybe family dinner is running a little long and cutting into your work time. Don't worry about it. Instead of getting up and leaving early, just make a note to work for a few extra minutes afterward. Work is important and something we all have to do, but we don't have to sacrifice family to do so.","I understand how difficult it can be to try to balance online work and time with family.

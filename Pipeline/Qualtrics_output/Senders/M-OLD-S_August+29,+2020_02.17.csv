While this probably isn't the case, it's important to address any concerns your family might have. I know from experience that when my wife had concerns about what I was doing and whether it was worthy of my time, we waited too long to talk about it, and it drove a wedge between us, unnecessarily. Keeping the lines of communication open will help immensely. Another important thing I've found is to keep a strict schedule, so your family knows when you will be available and when you will be ""at work"" online. Coordinate this with your family schedule, and be sure to communicate your hours in advance. Another thing I do is share small victories with my wife. I'll pop out into the living room and say something like, ""Hey, I'm getting all kinds of work done today. It feels great!"" I think she really appreciates when she knows that she stays on my mind even when I'm working. The last thing that's important to me is to stay focused as best as possible. It's easy to get distracted at home. Staying focused will allow you to get your work done quicker and get you to your family life sooner.","Doing any kind of work with family obligations is hard, but when the work is done online, it can sometimes look like you're avoiding your family obligations.

It is best to have a quiet place in the home to work and instruct other family members that you should not be disturbed unless there is an emergency.  If you have children, it is helpful to have established break times to take care of things like helping them with schoolwork, getting meals, and other tasks.  If your hours are flexible, this can also help in setting aside family time.  

If your job includes Zoom meetings and other live interaction with co workers and/or clients, then it is also helpful to have headphones and to be in an isolated area if possible.  I do not advise working in the living room or another similar area where it can be loud or distractions can occur.  You do want to be able to hear what is going on to a small extent in other rooms in case help is needed.  For homes that do not have a dedicated office, a bedroom or similar quiet place might be necessary.  

Also if children are out of school and working from home, I find they tend to sleep in.  This might be a good time to get some important work tasks completed while the house is entirely quiet.  Either the very end of the day or the very beginning has typically been the quietest time for me.  ","I have been in this position.

This means a quiet area that the younger kids or even the spouse should respect and stay out of while you are working. This will give you freedom to concentrate on your work properly.

That said, you shouldn't let work dominate your life either, and you must set boundaries on the amount of time you spend on it. Make certain to stop for family meals if possible. Some families no longer gather for meals, but it can tie you together better. 

And I find it better not to work too late at night.  This can interfere with your sleep and ruin your sleeping rhythms.

Since at-home work is flexible for most, this means you can adjust your work schedule when necessary.  Take part in your partner's interests occasionally.  For example, my brother's wife is an artist, and she has contacts in a lot of different art communities.  This often has her organizing events or attending events he wouldn't normally be able to attend due to work constraints.  But with a more flexible schedule, he can take part. So don't let your work be a barrier between yourself and the important events of your family.

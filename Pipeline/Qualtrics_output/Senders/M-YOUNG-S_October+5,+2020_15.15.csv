Everyone has a different dynamic due to different factors like age, spouse, kids, and other responsibilities. Everyone's routine is different. Finding the perfect balance can take time. It's easy to neglect your own needs and health because of daily obligations. Having a good exercise,  diet, sleep routine is very important to your overall success.",0,77,gone

The best advice I can offer is wake up early to get a start on working, the best jobs are in the morning! Even with taking a few breaks throughout the day to meet your family obligations you can still make a good additional income. Another thing that will help is using mturk suite. You will catch way more hits this way. Just staying organized helps too.Another thing I can recommend is looking on r/mturk for advice, or just other worker's experiences on the platform as well as your own. Another thing I can reccomend is trying to get the number of jobs done up, as well as watching out for low rated requesters. Looking at reviews helps a lot. The more you do on here the more jobs that will become available. Taking care of your family and working might not seem easy but you can do it! A routine and a schedule will help you stay focused and let you get  more done throughout the day. I can also say that preperparing meals might save you time during the day as well. Will give more time to work.","You still have time to work online and care for you family. The best advice I can offer is wake up early to get a start on working, the best jobs are in the morning!

The only difference between the two is that one is done at home where your family is present, and the other at the actual location. I would say that working online and at home is even better because your family gets to see you and you get to see them. But just like working on site, you get to have a schedule where you work your wor hours and then you have time for your actual family time. In my own experience, I am my own contractor. I have pretty much a work schedule but its for my work at home, and I explain to my own family that these hours are reserved for me and my work, and the payoff is that I get to take them out on nice trips, eat some meals that we want and other stuff. They understand that idea, especially my kids. A positive is also the fact that even when I'm working I get to physically see my partner and kids, and they get to see me. So being able to balance both family obligations and online work is totally do-able.

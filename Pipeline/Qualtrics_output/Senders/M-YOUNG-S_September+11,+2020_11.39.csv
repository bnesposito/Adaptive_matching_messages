However, sometimes I will have to modify those plans due to my family obligations. So the first thing I can advise yo is to know what you have to do each day, and make a plan for completing that work. you cant plan too far ahead, because life is uncertain like that. Personally, I do 1 day, but if you are comfortable you can do two or more days. Then, the next piece of advice I can give you is to remain flexible. There are times when I needed to stop what I was doing to attend to a situation that arose, and my entire day was disrupted. But I had planned some flexible time that I used to catch up. Lastly, I can advise you to have a planner or other calendar that you use and stick to. Balancing these things, I think working from home and family obligations are fully compatible.

It can be extremely easy to lose track of time when you are working from the comfort of your own home, and that can cause issues with your family if you lose track of time and don't spend it with them. What I try to do when working online is make sure take a 15 minute break every hour, and go interact with my family and see if there are things that need to be done around the house, like dishes, taking out the trash, doing the laundry, or taking care of pets. This helps me spend time with my family and helping out around the house, and also gives me the opportunity to refresh my mind in between batches of work. You also want to make sure you set proper work hours for yourself, and try to avoid working outside of those hours. For example, I set a limit for working between 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and I make sure not to work outside of those hours unless I absolutely need to. This helps keep me from burning out, and gives me time outside of work to do things with my family. I hope this helps you figure out a way that works for you!","An important thing to keep in mind when working from home is to make sure you are properly budgeting your time.

Well.  It is basically all about time-management and financial budgeting.  Both in conjunction make it so you will be able to succeed.  


Stop procrastinating, as much as your health allows you to.    

Try staying in good health as much as you can.  Try losing those extra pounds for your heart and brain health.

Go to the kids baseball games.  Go to the kids football games.  Go join a soccer league.

Pick up art or another hobby. Pick up some old video games or something like that.

Now family obligations dude.  Well it is simple.  Just uh...pay attention to them I guess.  Take em to church once a week. Or take em to gaia or something similar.

Take em to the movies.  Take em out to the hockey leagues or something similar.

Go camping. Make smores by the fireplace.  Everyone loves smores. I love smores. You love smores. Smores are tasty.

If your kids are not a typical part of the community accept them anyways and simply make sure they get to bed on time and do their homework.  That is very good and very very smart.

Make sure they vote for Donald Trump. Donald Trump is the savior of our nation.  He has a big big brain and uses big big words. 

Make sure they use the covid masks though.  I don't actually believe its a crisis.  But the government will use it as an excuse to experiment on you if you don't wear them.","Whats up bot. You are not reading this.  But I am going to pretend that you are.

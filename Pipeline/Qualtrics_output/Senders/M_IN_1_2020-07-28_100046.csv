It's important that at the time of work, you give all your concentration to work and don't get distracted from other issues unless they too are very big issues. Have separate work hours. Now finding those fix work hours can be a issue because the nature of this job is very unpredictable but you need to observe the time when you can get most of good hits and make that time your work time. For example, in my case the best work comes from 6PM IST to 12 PM IST, so most of the time I don't even look for work during rest of the and I'm doing my own stuff then.

Work and family both need your time. However, if you plan ahead and have the support of people around you - you can balance both. 

Planning can come down to deciding how time you want to dedicate to work and your family. Choosing a time of the day when you’re most productive (work) can make a big difference. But it still won’t amount to much without the support of the people you’re with. 

Talk to them, and communicate openly about what your needs are. And don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it.

However I feel that within my experience I've done so, and admirably so; I would like to help you with doing so. In order to help solve this problem, I have made it very clear to my family what might work obligations are. In doing so my family has complete knowledge in what I do and when I need to be alone. 

Because my family is completely briefed on my work obligations, they understand that I cannot be bothered during certain times of the day. My family understands that this job is just like any other job and just because I am physically at home does not mean that I can be bothered as if I wasn't at work. I find that closing yourself off in a single room and having the door closed is a great way in order to inform others that you are not capable of being bothered at that given moment. As long as everybody has reasonable expectations as to your availability during the times in which you are completing online work, your family should have no problems with the short amount of time that you will be available to help with their needs whilst at work.","Managing work online when you work from home while also dealing with familial obligations is something difficult to overcome.

I know it is very tough because it feels compelling to work longer hours since all your materials are a few steps away, and it is easy to login and just work. To add with this, family time has been pushed aside.

As a 20-something year old who is currently dealing with this same exact problem, I know it is very tough to separate it, but you should know that work will always pile up. Work is always going to have something to do even when you finish up all your projects/assignments. Family, on the other hand, is becoming a very rare obligations especially with the pandemic. Everyone is at risk, and we don't know when this will end. I would say enjoy the best you can (with social distancing rules) with friends and family because they can be the ones who will help through this tough times. Work will always be there.

Remember, you are working for the company, but they do not care about you in the long run. Your family, on the other hand, are always there for you no matter what.

We aren't immortal beings, we are human beings and we need to remember that we only live once (no offense if you believe in reincarnation) and to choose to live our lives how we want to.

At the start of each day, I try to realistically plan the work that I'll be able to get done. In most cases, I'm able to complete this work. One of the other methods that I try to do when needed is separating one from the other. When I'm handling really important work tasks, I try to really focus on these tasks.

Nonetheless, my experience from that period was that it was very helpful to set very clear boundaries on what time was designated for work and what time was designated for family obligations and other non-work activities. For me, that meant creating and sticking tightly to a schedule of when I would work, so that I could focus on family once my working hours were over. When working online for someone else (i.e. your employer), it is likely that your job already requires you to follow a schedule of some sort, or at least are expected to work a certain number of hours every day. If your job does not give you such a schedule, you should consider asking your manager if such an arrangement would be possible.
Once you have a work schedule, you will be able to focus on work during specific times, leaving other designated times for family obligations. If your job cannot be performed on a fixed or at least predictable schedule, or your employer refuses to cooperate with such a request from you, then you may have a problem separating work and family life. If that happens and you cannot come up with any mitigating strategies for controlling your work life, then you may have to consider finding another job that fits your life better.

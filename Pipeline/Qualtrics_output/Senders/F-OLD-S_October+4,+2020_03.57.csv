The most important thing you can do now while your approved hits are low in number is avoid rejections.  There's safety in numbers so I would recommend you take some time and review Turkerview, an online website which compiles reviews and stats on requesters, a current list of open qualification tests, and a daily hits forum.  It is a vast site with a great group of dedicated and experienced turkers. 

I live alone so I am not sure about reconciling online work with family obligations but there are plenty of folks with families on Turkerview as well as on some of the other sites, Turker Nation, Turkkit / Reddit, Turkopticon, the MTurk hashtag on Twitter, etc. Turkkit has an excellent section dedicated to new Turkers with a host of tips. Beware the snark on the daily feed!

I'm a senior citizen and it took me many months to get up to speed.  Once I started using MTurk Suite, jobs picked up, 1000 hits came and went.  Monthly income steadily increased as I found my way through the tools offered by MTurk Suite - Hit Finder, Hit Catcher, and Hit Tracker.  

The pandemic, alas, has increased the number of workers so the competition is a bit more fierce than it was.  Requesters are also undergoing contraction in some areas.  Hopefully as the winter comes on these sources of will stabilize and come back up to speed.  

Good Luck, no doubt you will find your niche on MTurk!          ","Well, congratulations for having 100 hits under your belt.

My work online required me to be in a quiet, uninterrupted state, and I was able to choose my own hours. Having children, and a husband who worked online at home as well, I was always making new rules. My time was constantly interrupted. I finally had a family meeting, during which time we outlined my husband's and my own work time. One of us would always be available at the time our children were home, and we would split all our family obligations equally. The times that we were to be uninterrupted would be posted on the refrigerator, and in the children's rooms. 

A month later, after a few relapses and some frustrated moments, our life became better, albeit more organized. Each of us had our quiet time to focus totally on work, and we all had a fuller family life. Without the frustration of not accomplishing either a good family life or our working obligations, we were a happier and freer family.

It will take some adjusting time, as I said; however, you won't be sorry. Your life will be more fulfilling.

Three areas I try to think about when balancing the two are obtaining buy-in, appropriate scheduling and sharing rewards.

Obtaining buy-in - Once you have some experience with online work, you have a better understanding of what it entails in terms of commitments and rewards. Reflect on this and share what you’ve learned with your family members. Tell them how much you enjoy it, how you appreciate being able to add value at your own pace and gain a sense of satisfaction from your work. Ask them what impact it’s had from their perspective and listen to their feedback.

Appropriate scheduling - Communication with family members before committing to work each day is helpful. Once expectations are clear and agreed upon, family members will appreciate that you need your own time but you will also make time for them. Online work is fairly flexible so is easy to fit in between other family commitments.

Sharing rewards - Occasionally share your thoughts about your work with family members. Tell them how much your opinion matters on surveys, how it shapes messaging, contributes to social influence research and provides important results for educational research. Additionally, share your earnings so they can see the monetary rewards do add up. Maybe take them for a family treat with some of your earnings!

These are a few ways to balance the online work and family responsibilities.

The importance of having a task/calendar manager cannot be overstated.  Franklin-Covey planners work well if you attend to them constantly, but, I find that the task manager on my Android phone is by far the simplest, easily managed task list and calendar setup you could get.  Franklin (I carried one for years, refilled it anually) was such a slogging pain in the ass.  Seemed you were supposed to not only take the classes, but attend to it all through the day....5 year plans seem to be a bit much for me when I just need to get things done during the day.  It (the Franklin-Covey planner) ended up being a glorified address book.",0,24,gone

I have found that by working online I have become far more productive, both at work and at home.  I am able to spend less time commuting which, over the course of a week, adds up to several hours.  That is found time!!  You can use that time to perform many tasks to prepare for your day, both work and home related.  Your family will appreciate you being around the house.  Just having your presence home makes all family members feel good.  Once you can establish off limit work spaces and work hours that your family knows must be respected, you will find yourself more relaxed and, typically, more productive.  Working online also provides you the opportunity to stay focused without the interruptions of coworkers.   It is surprising how much time is wasted at work due to constant stimuli pulling you away from the task at hand.  I recommend that you maintain a regular schedule that everyone in your household and your workplace can respect and deal with. Now, it's time to relax, focus and get to work!  Grab that cup of coffee and smile!","While working online from home has its pros and cons, one can truly find that the pros far outweigh the cons.

From personal experience, I failed to accomplish this properly due to fact that I spent way too much time performing online work tasks and totally ignored my family responsibilities. 
My advice is to make sure you take the time to attend to needs of your loved ones. Do not shut them out and ignore them. Be responsible, caring, and attentive to your family. Make sure you listen to them, really hear what they are telling you. My failures in this area has caused tremendous hurt and disappointment in my personal relationships.
Maintaining a healthy balance between online work and family obligation is very well possible and can be accomplished with the right mix of time management and understanding the true needs of your family. Make sure you are there for them when you are needed. Take the time to participate in family obligations and duties. Take the time to do fun and exciting things with your family. Taking the time to spend with family is one the most important things one can do, make sure you take advantage of it now or it will be gone before you know it.","I have found that trying to balance online work with family obligations can be somewhat difficult.

In my mind, I always put family first. Having said that, it is very hard not to put a lot of time into doing the MTurk work to pay bills and the basics such as food, transportation cost and just life. I will say that the longer you work on the MTurk platform the easier it is to make more money with less effort. When I first started, I took any and every job I could get. You need to learn how to choose and pick your best paying per hour jobs. Sometimes you can't go with the ratings you read about the requester. Sometimes you can make more money doing $.05 batch work than taking on a $10 survey that takes you 90 minutes. It is really about pacing. Remember to take breaks through the day and don't sit in front of the computer 12 hours a day waiting for the next big hit. When there is down time, do little $.25 surveys because those add up in a big way. Learn the tools that people have created to make catching HITS while you are working. Most of all, take care of yourself as this is a tough job, but it does get easier with time.

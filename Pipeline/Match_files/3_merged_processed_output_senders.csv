It helps to also set a schedule for family time or obligations. I think that prioritizing and being organized by using a schedule is a sucessful way to reconcile work and family obligations. This is the method that has worked best for me. 

When it's work time that is what you do, you work. When it is family time then that is what you do you spend time with family. 

People think that working online is a breeze but it takes a lot of self disipline and organization.

The second piece of advice that I would share is that the person who works from home must be able to switch tasks without a lot of difficulty. Let's face it, emergencies happen that the person working from home must deal with and being able to switch what you are doing is important.

 Probably the most important factor that makes up a successful online worker is patience and a positive attitude. Things go awry, and its best to not be too hard on yourself when they do. You will have good days and some that are not so good but overall things generally work out. I enjoy my online work even with the interruptions and dealing with family drama.

Since working online is often done in your home, with the family nearby, creating a solid boundary between your work and home life is absolutely crucial to finding a balance. If possible, it helps to have a separate room (or even a designated space in a room) where you will work. I have also found it extremely helpful to make schedules and set goals for myself for the week and beginning each morning.

I have been working from home for 22 years and I love it.  First off, work should be treated just as if you were going into the office and you need to establish a set start and stop time and adhere to it.  You need to ensure that you are not interrupted during those times, except for emergency.  You need to have a separate room/office to work, not on the dining room table or living room sofa.  You need to be able to close your door during sensitive discussions that your family should not hear.  If you talk on a phone for business, you need to have a separate line that the kids or family can't pop on, listen in, or tie up.  It needs to be dedicated for work.  You should take your normal breaks and lunch time.  Spend lunch with the family if they are at home.  After getting used to the routine, you may find that you are able to manage some other things during working hours, such as starting a load of laundry before work, and then on morning break, move it to the dryer, and at lunch time, remove it and put it away.  You need to get up and stretch - you're not in a prison.  Occasionally, it is nice to take your equipment outside in nice weather and work from there if possible, but be sure to avoid distractions.  You are working, and that should be your primary focus during working hours.  Remember, at quitting time for the day, log off, get up and leave your office.  Don't say you'll just finish a few more things - think of it as leaving the office to pick up the kids or something like that - it is a hard stop that you must adhere to.

The good news about your situation is that you might have had the opportunity to set aside a good chunk of money where you can work a little bit less to have that time with your family.
I don't manage my family obligations all that well. I work all the time, so I can make more money now. I make that decision because I want to have more fun during my true peak in life.

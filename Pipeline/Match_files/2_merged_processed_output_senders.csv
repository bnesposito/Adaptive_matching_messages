It is operated under Amazon Web Services, and is owned by Amazon. Employers post jobs known as Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), such as identifying specific content in an image or video, writing product descriptions, or answering questions, among others. Workers, colloquially known as Turkers or crowdworkers, browse among existing jobs and complete them in exchange for a rate set by the employer. To place jobs, the requesting programs use an open application programming interface (API), or the more limited MTurk Requester site. As of April 2019, Requesters could register from only 49 approved countrie.
A user of Mechanical Turk can be either a ""Worker"" (contractor) or a ""Requester"" (employer). Workers have access to a dashboard that displays three sections: total earnings, HIT status and HIT totals. Workers set their own hours and are not under any obligation to accept any particular task. Workers are classified by Amazon as contractors rather than employees, and refuse to file forms or pay payroll taxes. This is aimed to evade the minimum wage, overtime, and workers compensation. Workers must report their income as self-employment income. In 2013, the average wage for the multiple microtasks assigned, if performed quickly, is about one dollar an hour, with each task averaging a few cents. Workers can have a postal address anywhere in the world. Payment for completing tasks can be redeemed on Amazon.com via gift certificate (gift certificates are the only payment option available to international workers, apart from India) or be later transferred to a Worker's U.S. bank account.

Requesters can ask that Workers fulfill qualifications before engaging in a task, and they can set up a test in order to verify the qualification. They can also accept or reject the result sent by the Worker, which affects the Worker's reputation. As of April 2019, Requesters paid Amazon a minimum 20% commission on the price of successfully completed jobs, with increased amounts for additional services. Requesters can use the Amazon Mechanical Turk API to programmatically integrate the results of that work directly into their business processes and systems.

The second thing that you must do is carve out some time to spend with your family. This time should be used to talk and bond with your family. It will allow them to feel special and let them know that they are important to you. I will usually eat dinner with them and we discuss what happened today or the current events of the world.

I think some people are under the impression that because one works at home, one can just stop anytime to attend to another's needs.  We who do this type of work know that is not the case.  You have to work when it's available.  

I have had times when a family member needed my assistance (or, more often, simply wanted it).  If it was a real emergency, I would stop working as I didn't know what else to do.  While I was sort of annoyed that I was inconvenienced through lost pay, I usually did what I felt was needed.  Other times, I would be more straightforward with the person.  I would simply tell them I had to work and didn't want to abandon that work for something trivial.  The family member got peeved a few times, but I didn't feel guilty.  She didn't understand the situation fully.  

So, my advice is to stand up for yourself.  You need to make money sometimes and can't drop everything at the drop of a hat.  I ask the person to put themselves in my shoes.

They understood that  I need space to work and did distance themselves from me.
You can also just try doing the work when everyone is asleep if that is possible or even wake up really early to do it. I mostly did my work when everyone was asleep which gave me peace of mind. I remember this one day I tried doing my work at night but couldn't and then ended up missing the day's pay, so you do have to get used to it to work. 
But, mostly I would really suggest that you should make your family understand that working in the home is going to part of their lives and they have to give enough space for that.

It just results in hurt feelings on your family’s part, even if you have a few extra dollars in your bank account. That extra stress certainly is not worth it. Just monitor your time and consider setting a time limit for your online work. Ask your family members, too, about how much time you’re spending with them and online and see if they think it’s at an acceptable level. Their feedback can be instrumental to having a good balance.

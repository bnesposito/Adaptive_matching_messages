It helps to also set a schedule for family time or obligations. I think that prioritizing and being organized by using a schedule is a sucessful way to reconcile work and family obligations. This is the method that has worked best for me. 

When it's work time that is what you do, you work. When it is family time then that is what you do you spend time with family. 

People think that working online is a breeze but it takes a lot of self disipline and organization.

The second piece of advice that I would share is that the person who works from home must be able to switch tasks without a lot of difficulty. Let's face it, emergencies happen that the person working from home must deal with and being able to switch what you are doing is important.

 Probably the most important factor that makes up a successful online worker is patience and a positive attitude. Things go awry, and its best to not be too hard on yourself when they do. You will have good days and some that are not so good but overall things generally work out. I enjoy my online work even with the interruptions and dealing with family drama.

Having a spouse willing to help with family obligations is a wonderful thing, but not essential.  With cooperation from your family members it can all run very smoothly.

Perhaps your spouse can tell his/her work that they are available at certain hours for face to face meetings, while you are available at a different time so someone can watch the children if needed. I would also take advantage of keeping your video off and mic off when it is possible and perhaps use a bluetooth headset so you can walk around the house to go check something out when on a call.

Perhaps your spouse can tell his/her work that they are available at certain hours for face to face meetings, while you are available at a different time so someone can watch the children if needed. I would also take advantage of keeping your video off and mic off when it is possible and perhaps use a bluetooth headset so you can walk around the house to go check something out when on a call.

You should take your normal breaks and lunch time.  Spend lunch with the family if they are at home.

Doing these will expand your qualifications and in turn open up more available work to you.  Also look at the tools that you are using.  There are various tools out there to choose from.  One of the main must have's that became available only a couple of years ago is an extension on chrome (I believe it is also available on other's too) called MTurk Suite.  This is a must have.  The tracker will tell you how many hits you have completed in dollars, there is also a 'catcher' which helps you catch those hits that you want to work on but cannot catch then manually.   The Finder will alert you when a favorite requester starts to post work, this you can customize to your own preferences. You can also adapt this to your own work schedule for searching hits.  One last thing if you are not sure how to use these tools that you find Youtube is a really good resource as there are multiple how to videos posted on this subject.  With all this it will be a lot easier and you will find you can work any time of day whenever you have a spare moment from your own obligations.","Hi, my advice is pretty simple.  Every time you have any spare time search for qual or screener in the MTurk system.  This will bring up qualification or screener hits.  Doing these will expand your qualifications and in turn open up more available work to you.  Also look at the tools that you are using.  There are various tools out there to choose from.  One of the main must have's that became available only a couple of years ago is an extension on chrome (I believe it is also available on other's too) called MTurk Suite.  This is a must have.  The tracker will tell you how many hits you have completed in dollars, there is also a 'catcher' which helps you catch those hits that you want to work on but cannot catch then manually.   The Finder will alert you when a favorite requester starts to post work, this you can customize to your own preferences. You can also adapt this to your own work schedule for searching hits.  One last thing if you are not sure how to use these tools that you find Youtube is a really good resource as there are multiple how to videos posted on this subject.  With all this it will be a lot easier and you will find you can work any time of day whenever you have a spare moment from your own obligations.",0,6,gone,"M-OLD-S_August+14,+2020_03.04.csv",M,OLD,man over 50 years old,4,4

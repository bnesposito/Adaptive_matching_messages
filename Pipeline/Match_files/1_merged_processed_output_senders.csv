My kids are all off on their own, so my family obligations are mainly communication over the phone and email. My garden supplements my food supply, and I don't eat out. My social life is comprised of visiting with people in the nearby town and on the beaches, and that is down to a bare minimum with the pandemic. Hard times!
Honestly, I do not know how people are making it now a days. We used to be able to get a job that covered our expenses and left some for saving for the future. It looks pretty tough out there to me these days. If you have kids and only one income coming in, I do not see much room for saving and investing in your future in today's economy. 
If you are single with no dependents, that is another story. Online work can support you if you work long hours and get efficient at it. But if you have a family to support, my hat is off to you. At least you can work at home and have some kind of balance in your family life. Cut expenses as much as you can and live frugally and you can feed the pack, but it won't be easy.",0,3,gone,"M-OLD-S_August+12,+2020_12.32.csv",M,OL,NA,NA,NA

Well, it's a little more tricky than many people originally thought, but balancing online work and family obligations is not as difficult as you may have first expected.

The first thing you need to understand is that you have to be mindful of your time. This is the most important factor! If you are working, you are 100% working, not parenting. If you are parenting, you are not working. Not only will this help you to compartmentalize each aspect of your life, but you'll also be able to give more of an effort to each individual task. You'll become a better worker and a better parent.

Second, try to stick to a schedule, but not too much. Interruptions always occur and with today's uncertainty, you need to be prepared to react to things that are beyond your control.

Finally, in order to better reconcile online work with family obligations, you need to sometimes put yourself first. Your mental health should be one of your top priorities, since you can neither be a productive worker or good family man if you are depressed. Take some time for self-care throughout the day to do the things you enjoy without feeling guilty about them.

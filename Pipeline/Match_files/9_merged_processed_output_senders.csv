It helps to also set a schedule for family time or obligations. I think that prioritizing and being organized by using a schedule is a sucessful way to reconcile work and family obligations. This is the method that has worked best for me. 

When it's work time that is what you do, you work. When it is family time then that is what you do you spend time with family. 

People think that working online is a breeze but it takes a lot of self disipline and organization.

The second piece of advice that I would share is that the person who works from home must be able to switch tasks without a lot of difficulty. Let's face it, emergencies happen that the person working from home must deal with and being able to switch what you are doing is important.

 Probably the most important factor that makes up a successful online worker is patience and a positive attitude. Things go awry, and its best to not be too hard on yourself when they do. You will have good days and some that are not so good but overall things generally work out. I enjoy my online work even with the interruptions and dealing with family drama.

I am writing trying to help you reconcile online work with family obligations. Let me tell you, it will require effort and commitment!. It will be challenging many times, but not undoable.

It is importwnt that you have a private space for work, where family should not interrupt at all. It is also important not to stay working longer than needed, and attend family needs according to the schedule you have set.

I would also take advantage of keeping your video off and mic off when it is possible and perhaps use a bluetooth headset so you can walk around the house to go check something out when on a call.

Period!!!","Ok so working from home is one thing, but working from home if you have children is another deal entirely. Ok that being said it isn't Rocket science here. Whether you work outside the home or in it online or offline. A 40 hr week is the full time assumption. How I worked it out is  after having over 30 years of working full time out of the home , I quickly realized that it wasn't me that had to adapt as much as my family did. My work time is MY work time and MY WIFE AND KIDS MUST RESPECT THAT and go about their day like I wasn't home whatever that may be. I am self disciplined enough to keep myself focused , but others in the home need to have the attitude that you are NOT available for 8 hrs or more. Just like when I worked outside the home. This is the only way it works no matter how committed YOU are. The entire home has to be on board and respect the unavailabilty. Period!
If you are just dabbling in online or at home work , then that is an entirely different matter. All the above is for someone trying full time work online from home.",0,5,gone,"M-OLD-S_August+14,+2020_03.04.csv",M,OLD,man over 50 years old,4,4

I will say that the longer you work on the MTurk platform the easier it is to make more money with less effort. When I first started, I took any and every job I could get. You need to learn how to choose and pick your best paying per hour jobs. Sometimes you can't go with the ratings you read about the requester. Sometimes you can make more money doing $.05 batch work than taking on a $10 survey that takes you 90 minutes. It is really about pacing. Remember to take breaks through the day and don't sit in front of the computer 12 hours a day waiting for the next big hit. When there is down time, do little $.25 surveys because those add up in a big way. Learn the tools that people have created to make catching HITS while you are working.

Well, it's a little more tricky than many people originally thought, but balancing online work and family obligations is not as difficult as you may have first expected.

The first thing you need to understand is that you have to be mindful of your time. This is the most important factor! If you are working, you are 100% working, not parenting. If you are parenting, you are not working. Not only will this help you to compartmentalize each aspect of your life, but you'll also be able to give more of an effort to each individual task. You'll become a better worker and a better parent.

Second, try to stick to a schedule, but not too much. Interruptions always occur and with today's uncertainty, you need to be prepared to react to things that are beyond your control.

Finally, in order to better reconcile online work with family obligations, you need to sometimes put yourself first. Your mental health should be one of your top priorities, since you can neither be a productive worker or good family man if you are depressed. Take some time for self-care throughout the day to do the things you enjoy without feeling guilty about them.

Because you're home your family thinks you're free and available for anything; dinners, babysitting, chores. But a lot of times that simply isn't the case. Last week my brother asked me to come babysit his daughter in the middle of the workday. My girlfriend gave me some grief for not going to lunch with her. These are things I WANTED to do but simply couldn't because even though it doesn't appear like it when I'm at home with a laptop in front of the TV, but I actually am working. 

I think a good tip to handle this is to just talk to your family and make them understand your situation. Just because you're around doesn't mean you're available. Sure, there are times during a workday I can take it easy and give time to my family but when the work piles up they for the most part understand I can't be bothered. Setting boundaries like that is very important. After 5 pm I'm all yours, but before that I can't give you all of the attention that I normally would. It's important that your family understands that.","Working from home seems like the easiest thing in the world but it's actually really difficult, especially if you're trying to juggle other obligations.

The biggest thing I have learned is in order to separate the two, you need to set clear boundaries and share those with your colleagues and family. 

First, I would recommend having a dedicated workspace. Even if you don’t have an office, set aside one room for working and let everyone know that while you are in that space, you are focused on work. By setting up this workspace, it tells your mind that when you are there you are to focus on work, but also enables you to be kept alone from your family until you come out.

Additionally, try to keep as normal of a routine as possible. If you would normally get to the office around 8 and stay until 4, stay on that schedule. This keeps you from working too many hours and allows your family to know when they can see you and when you are working. Once your day is over, do not check emails or log back on, as tempting as it might be.

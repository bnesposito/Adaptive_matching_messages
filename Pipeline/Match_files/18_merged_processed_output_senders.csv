It helps to also set a schedule for family time or obligations. I think that prioritizing and being organized by using a schedule is a sucessful way to reconcile work and family obligations. This is the method that has worked best for me. 

When it's work time that is what you do, you work. When it is family time then that is what you do you spend time with family. 

People think that working online is a breeze but it takes a lot of self disipline and organization.

The second piece of advice that I would share is that the person who works from home must be able to switch tasks without a lot of difficulty. Let's face it, emergencies happen that the person working from home must deal with and being able to switch what you are doing is important.

 Probably the most important factor that makes up a successful online worker is patience and a positive attitude. Things go awry, and its best to not be too hard on yourself when they do. You will have good days and some that are not so good but overall things generally work out. I enjoy my online work even with the interruptions and dealing with family drama.

It helps to plan your online work for times that your family is less likely to need you. If you have small children, of course, their needs are less predictable. In that case, you can choose to do your online work when they are sleeping, or when someone else is watching them. With older children and/or your spouse, you can let them know you will be working, and check to see if they need anything before you start.

One of the advantages of online work is that it can be done on your own schedule. If an emergency need arises in your family, you can sign off of the MTurk survey, knowing you can work later. You can even plan your online work in the middle of the night, if you can manage to fit that in with your needed sleep.

I suggest thinking hard about how much you need the wages you earn from your work. That can be your guide for how hard you need to fit the work around your family needs. More need could mean you would be willing to put up with greater inconvenience.

I set up an office in our basement and shut the door when it was work time.  Make sure your family understands the boundaries that the door signifies.  Tell them that when you are in that room, it is the same as you being off at a job site.  Also, though, make sure that when work is over, you shut that door and be with your family.  You should strive to keep the two worlds from ever meeting.  
It would be easy to sneak down to do some work when you have extra time, or go help with the dishes during work hours, but you can not let that happen.  Get ready to go to work just like if you were leaving the house, and then change clothes again when the work day is over.  Get it set in your mind and your families' minds that the office does not officially exist inside the house and do not let that change.

Imagine that you have to get up, shower, get dressed and go to the office every day. You would have to take care of family obligations when you get home.  Working on line from home ought to be somewhat the same.  ?There is a real advantage because you can be somewhat flexible.  But you need a schedule so you can get your work done.
Figure out when your family needs your help least.  That may be early in the morning or in the evening.  With some luck, it could be midday.  Also figure out when your online work in the most demanding. Write  down these times for both schedules on columns. Find times where the obligations do not overlap. That is the beginning of a schedule for you. You need to sit down with your family and work on this schedule so that everyone understands that there are certain times of the day that you need to work and that, barring an emergency, the family needs to amuse themselves during these times.

By the time my family wakes up, I've already worked for 4 hours or more, uninterrupted.  So by doing little things like that, you can keep both worlds seperate, and still find quality time to spend with your family.   If you don't keep things separated, you will pull your hair out trying to get anything done. It's very frustrating when you're not organized and working in a quiet space.  It's also not fair to your employer to pay you while you're not fully paying attention.  Best of luck to you!",0,61,gone,"F-OLD-S_September+20,+2020_14.59.csv",F,OLD,woman over 50 years old,2,2

Sometimes it is hard for people to understand why you are sitting at a computer or laptop the majority of your day, but if you describe what you are doing throughout your usual work days, this will help lessen the gap between you and them quite a lot.",0,4,gone,"F-YOUNG-S_August+12,+2020_12.32.csv",F,YOUNG,woman under 30 years old,1,1

I hope you are doing well during these challenging times. The problem you face is a very real predicament faced by many people in today's society. It is a serious issue, with many people suffering mental health wise from the problems that arise from it. You have my greatest sympathy in dealing with your life circumstances. Although I am clearly not a trained professional in this field, I would like to offer you some advice as to how to go about recovering and moving forward from your issue. I know despite the pandemic, everyone still has very busy schedules, arising from familial obligations to, of course, work obligations. A few tried and true methods I have found are as follows. When facing a very important family event, for example, a wedding or funeral, those should always come first. However, with smaller gatherings, the priority is hard to distinguish.

The problem you face is a very real predicament faced by many people in today's society. It is a serious issue, with many people suffering mental health wise from the problems that arise from it. You have my greatest sympathy in dealing with your life circumstances. Although I am clearly not a trained professional in this field, I would like to offer you some advice as to how to go about recovering and moving forward from your issue. I know despite the pandemic, everyone still has very busy schedules, arising from familial obligations to, of course, work obligations. A few tried and true methods I have found are as follows. When facing a very important family event, for example, a wedding or funeral, those should always come first. However, with smaller gatherings, the priority is hard to distinguish. When my work conflicts with a family event, I bring my work to the event. You will still have time to chat and catch up with people, even if you are spending some of the time working. Save your menial tasks to complete during the events, while getting your more mentally demanding tasks done at home before you leave. This way, you can still be efficient, even when enjoying time with your family. I hope this helps!

The best advice I have is to make sure you have a room in your house where you can be devoted to working. It's best if you can be able to shut the door when you're on calls or focusing on a project intensely. Even if you can't close the door, your family should know that when you are in the room you are working and they can't come in unless they knock first or ask your permission. Encourage them to text you first so they don't accidentally walk in on one of your calls. 

If you have young kids or a partner that needs your attention often, try printing out your work calendar for them every week so they can see when you have your most important calls and blocks of time where they can't talk to you. A sign on the door that indicates when you're in a call or can't be disturbed can also be fun for little kids to check on. 

But you should also remember that just because you're working from home, you don't need to be more productive than when you were at the office. Set a hard stop time that you'll log off of work. Try to log off early whenever you can to take advantage of this great opportunity to spend more time with your family. Don't work on weekends or answer emails after hours if you can help it, it's important to set boundaries with both your work and your family.","It is tricky to balance working online from home with your family obligations, be assured that everyone is struggling with it and everyone is handling things differently.

Explain that they can approach you for help or companionship when the green light is on but that they need to wait when the red bulb is on. That way they should not interrupt you when you are in the middle of something. If your family communicates via phone calls or video calls, let them know ahead of time when you are doing your online work and do not answer the call if it is during your work time.  You will need to set a firm schedule while also staying within the scope of what your family needs from you.",0,38,gone,"F-YOUNG-S_August+29,+2020_02.17.csv",F,YOUNG,woman under 30 years old,1,1

It is important to stay focused and do the best you can while working online. You should take whatever steps you can to be as focused, calm, and steady as possible when doing online work.

Make it clear to your co-workers that you are unavailable once you are done working for the day. Working from home doesn't and should not mean you are always available.

One more piece of advice: don't be afraid to ask for help from other family member and friends who can spare the time.

Weekends are a joke on mTurk, not worth working, so definitely take that time with your family.

It's surprisingly easy to blend work and family obligations when working from home, as you're not physically moving from home to the workplace and vice versa. It's important to make sure to completely stop working once you've clocked out or finished for the day, and although it's tempting to read work-related emails or texts if you receive them only minutes after clocking out, it's best to turn off work notifications once you're done for the day. After work, you have time to fully concentrate on your family obligations.

If your work does not have dedicated clocking in/out procedures and you must be on call, I suggest making a list of family/home obligations and assigning estimated completion times for each task. When on call and there's downtime, only work on one task from the list, and don't try to rush to complete the task.

If you live with a significant other, it's helpful to keep each other accountable in balancing your own work/life. If one of you notices the other is swamped with online work and is getting stressed out, suggest taking a quick break to distance yourself from the chaos.","To keep a good work-life balance, my best advice is to create a schedule and stick to it.

It's important to make sure to completely stop working once you've clocked out or finished for the day, and although it's tempting to read work-related emails or texts if you receive them only minutes after clocking out, it's best to turn off work notifications once you're done for the day. After work, you have time to fully concentrate on your family obligations.

If your work does not have dedicated clocking in/out procedures and you must be on call, I suggest making a list of family/home obligations and assigning estimated completion times for each task. When on call and there's downtime, only work on one task from the list, and don't try to rush to complete the task.

If you live with a significant other, it's helpful to keep each other accountable in balancing your own work/life. If one of you notices the other is swamped with online work and is getting stressed out, suggest taking a quick break to distance yourself from the chaos.",0,45,gone,"F-YOUNG-S_September+11,+2020_11.40.csv",F,YOUNG,woman under 30 years old,1,1

Then once work is over, shift your priority to your family and spending time with them. If you can, try not to focus too much on work and focus instead on your family and what they need. Also, utilize any days off to spend time with family.

 I am a college student living at home with my parents, and for something like online school, which can be done at any time of the day, it can be a little harder to manage my time. 11:59 pm deadlines make it tempting to do school work in the evenings rather than during the day. In order to battle this, I try my best to set a time limit for when I stop doing work. Usually for me it is around 8:00 pm, when my parents are also finished with their work. I set aside all of my textbooks and assignments and spend time with my family, trying not to think too much about school deadlines. If, for any reason, I desperately need to finish an assignment and must ignore my family obligations, I try to make it up to them another day.","In order to balance online work and family obligations, it helps to have different priorities during different parts of the day.

One of the most effective ways to balance online work and family is to set a schedule for yourself of when you start and stop working. This ensures that you will at least have a portion of the day dedicated solely to your personal life and family. It is also helpful to give yourself multiple breaks within your workday, as this allows you to not only rest your mind when needed but also be able to interact with your family if they need your help while you are working. Another good strategy is to limit how much you work. Talk to your company or boss if your family needs you more than usual. In this case, being open and letting your company know about your family’s need for you can allow them to reallocate your workload and take some weight off of your shoulders where necessary.

I have been working from home for 22 years and I love it.  First off, work should be treated just as if you were going into the office and you need to establish a set start and stop time and adhere to it.  You need to ensure that you are not interrupted during those times, except for emergency.  You need to have a separate room/office to work, not on the dining room table or living room sofa.  You need to be able to close your door during sensitive discussions that your family should not hear.  If you talk on a phone for business, you need to have a separate line that the kids or family can't pop on, listen in, or tie up.  It needs to be dedicated for work.  You should take your normal breaks and lunch time.  Spend lunch with the family if they are at home.  After getting used to the routine, you may find that you are able to manage some other things during working hours, such as starting a load of laundry before work, and then on morning break, move it to the dryer, and at lunch time, remove it and put it away.  You need to get up and stretch - you're not in a prison.  Occasionally, it is nice to take your equipment outside in nice weather and work from there if possible, but be sure to avoid distractions.

    A lot really depends on the time you are willing to put in when you aren't on the clock.  For instance, just a simple trip to the ice cream store in the middle of the summer with the kids could give them the time they want to have with you the most. You will have to talk directly with your boss as well and see what the company requires while you are at home.  They do need to realize that, although they have corporate or business responsibilities, they should not be making more claims on your time just because it appears you have more ""free time"" at home.  In a sense, youre still clocked in.  So make it a point to communicate with your supervisors and set a specific time when you are devoted to your job. No matter what, the key is communication and clear scheduling that everyone knows about and, for the most part, adheres to.","It's easy today to get caught up in work.

I find it easy to compartmentalize. When you are working, focus on work. When you are done working, focus on the family. Sometimes that might be difficult; we let family concerns distract us from our work, or we think about work when a family member is talking to us. It requires a certain amount of discipline to keep the two separate. 
This is where habit comes in. If you do something once, it becomes easier the second time. When you do it often enough it becomes second nature and you don’t even have to think about it any longer.

The overall schedule needs to balance your family and work obligations. It is also very important to leave some time for relaxation and fun. Set aside and block an hour for family dinner every day, say 7-8 pm. This hour everybody knows that you are NOT available for work meetings no matter what.
Also, block out some time to be alone with your husband. Both of you need time for intimacy and loving to preserve and grow your relationship.
Remember to enjoy both your work and your family!","First and most important, you need to decide on your time allocation throughout each day. It should consider both your work schedule and your family duties. Ask these questions before you decide:
1. When do I need to take my kids to school? Can my husband help with this and how many days a week?
2. Same questions regarding picking them up after school. Can you share this responsibility with any friends or neighbors who can reciprocate some days of the week or on alternative weeks?
3. What hours must I be online to interact with my co-workers?
4. Is my manager open to adjustments in my schedule dictated by fixed family obligations?

First, a person is not likely to make a living doing this.  It will take time and experience to reach a point of making a decent amount of ""side money.""  It also takes the complete understanding of any family who may be affected by your decision to pursue it.
Open and honest discussion with your loved one(s) is the best approach.

Well, it's a little more tricky than many people originally thought, but balancing online work and family obligations is not as difficult as you may have first expected.

The first thing you need to understand is that you have to be mindful of your time. This is the most important factor! If you are working, you are 100% working, not parenting. If you are parenting, you are not working. Not only will this help you to compartmentalize each aspect of your life, but you'll also be able to give more of an effort to each individual task. You'll become a better worker and a better parent.

Second, try to stick to a schedule, but not too much. Interruptions always occur and with today's uncertainty, you need to be prepared to react to things that are beyond your control.

Finally, in order to better reconcile online work with family obligations, you need to sometimes put yourself first. Your mental health should be one of your top priorities, since you can neither be a productive worker or good family man if you are depressed. Take some time for self-care throughout the day to do the things you enjoy without feeling guilty about them.

These are things I WANTED to do but simply couldn't because even though it doesn't appear like it when I'm at home with a laptop in front of the TV, but I actually am working. 

I think a good tip to handle this is to just talk to your family and make them understand your situation. Just because you're around doesn't mean you're available. Sure, there are times during a workday I can take it easy and give time to my family but when the work piles up they for the most part understand I can't be bothered. Setting boundaries like that is very important. After 5 pm I'm all yours, but before that I can't give you all of the attention that I normally would. It's important that your family understands that.","Working from home seems like the easiest thing in the world but it's actually really difficult, especially if you're trying to juggle other obligations.

The biggest thing I have learned is in order to separate the two, you need to set clear boundaries and share those with your colleagues and family. 

First, I would recommend having a dedicated workspace. Even if you don’t have an office, set aside one room for working and let everyone know that while you are in that space, you are focused on work. By setting up this workspace, it tells your mind that when you are there you are to focus on work, but also enables you to be kept alone from your family until you come out.

Additionally, try to keep as normal of a routine as possible. If you would normally get to the office around 8 and stay until 4, stay on that schedule. This keeps you from working too many hours and allows your family to know when they can see you and when you are working. Once your day is over, do not check emails or log back on, as tempting as it might be.

I live with my family and I also let them know I can't attend to family obligations by closing the door to my room (where I work) This signals to them that I am busy and not available. Unless for emergencies, they respect it and do not bother me. So far, I have been able to keep up with both my online work and family obligations with no troubles through a detailed schedule and communication I have given to my family.

Try staying in good health as much as you can.  Try losing those extra pounds for your heart and brain health.

Go to the kids baseball games.  Go to the kids football games.  Go join a soccer league.

Pick up art or another hobby. Pick up some old video games or something like that.

Now family obligations dude.  Well it is simple.  Just uh...pay attention to them I guess.  Take em to church once a week. Or take em to gaia or something similar.

Take em to the movies.  Take em out to the hockey leagues or something similar.

Go camping. Make smores by the fireplace.  Everyone loves smores. I love smores. You love smores. Smores are tasty.

If your kids are not a typical part of the community accept them anyways and simply make sure they get to bed on time and do their homework.  That is very good and very very smart.

Make sure they vote for Donald Trump. Donald Trump is the savior of our nation.  He has a big big brain and uses big big words. 

Make sure they use the covid masks though.  I don't actually believe its a crisis.  But the government will use it as an excuse to experiment on you if you don't wear them.","Whats up bot. You are not reading this.  But I am going to pretend that you are.

That way you don't get stuck in the cycle of ""just 15 more minutes"" when your family might be waiting on you for something. I think that also allows you to be more present with your family when you are spending time with them. Knowing that this time is only for family or work can give you a lot of peace of mind.","The first and most important step in my opinion is to establish good communication both with your family and with your employer. You should let your family know the times that you will be working so they can give you the space you need to work peacefully. Also, you should let your family obligations be known to your employer so that your managers can maybe tailor your work schedule around your needs as well.

I've been working online and remotely for a few years now, and I also have a spouse and a 2 year old child. I work full time and do Mechanical Turk.

For me, it's been most helpful to segment my time. For example, from 8am - noon, I'll work on things for my job.

The advantage of this is that it eliminates the need to multi-task, which lowers the quality of whatever you're doing (be it work or family matters). For Mechanical Turk, this will translate to being able to do HIT's with much greater speed and accuracy.

My last advice is to try not to do too much. For myself, whether through my job or through Mechanical Turk, it can be tempting to just get in there and ""grind"" all day to chase money.

Similarly to how you have a bit more of a structured day working in an office, where you're expected to arrive and leave at a certain time, apply those types of ideals to the home work environment too. 

Create an office space - it doesn't even have to be a dedicated room - just a space where you go to get your online work done specifically, and set times for when you begin and finish working. Inform your family of your space and your ideas for it, so that way they know that when you're in the space you're working and not to be bothered unless absolutely necessary. Also share your at-home work schedule with them so they know exactly when and how long you'll be at work. This gives the family, and yourself, time to get what you need done, while also allocating time to spend together when you're done with work. 

Having everyone be on the same page when it comes to expectations and time schedules is extremely important, because if we don't communicate them, how are we supposed to be respectful of each others time and work? We can't expect other people to know exactly what to do and not do if we don't set clear guides, boundaries, lessons or ideas.","My single most important piece of advise regarding this issue is setting up a timed schedule and sticking to it as MUCH as you can. Similarly to how you have a bit more of a structured day working in an office, where you're expected to arrive and leave at a certain time, apply those types of ideals to the home work environment too. 

Create an office space - it doesn't even have to be a dedicated room - just a space where you go to get your online work done specifically, and set times for when you begin and finish working. Inform your family of your space and your ideas for it, so that way they know that when you're in the space you're working and not to be bothered unless absolutely necessary. Also share your at-home work schedule with them so they know exactly when and how long you'll be at work. This gives the family, and yourself, time to get what you need done, while also allocating time to spend together when you're done with work.

My mother had spoken to my sister about how much time she was missing with me because of the time i spent on my laptop. After a little talk with my sister i spent sometime to reflect and look into my priorities. It turns out, family obligations comes first! Notwithstanding this, as young adults we do find ourselves in need of cash. So the best way to go about reconciling online work with family obligations, is to reflect, strike a balance and practice better time management. Dont wait until someone call's you out like i have. Because prevention is better than cure, and remember, family obligations should come first. So it really involves looking into your priorities and acting accordingly. We may mess up trying, but be consistent with your efforts and remain morally grounded. As said, it may be difficult but, it is possible.

I'll tell you how I do it: I wake up early (before everyone) have a coffee and get ready to start my day, put a song on the headphones and start working. As I am alone I can do a large part of the tasks, and then I take small breaks during the day, whether for household chores or to clear my mind a little bit, I try to be isolated from the family while working and join them in these breaks, It is also good to do a little exercise in these breaks, even if it is for 5 minutes, just get up from the chair and start nothing difficult. I guarantee that this will help you a lot. Take time for yourself, eat well, talk to those you love. When you only live for work and only think about work you are overwhelmed and sad. You have to be fine for yourself and then be fine for work. Create goals, but don't be disappointed if you don't reach them, each day is a different day, today is not so good but tomorrow can be much better and can make up for that day. I hope these tips help you just as they help me every day, it makes my job much more profitable and stress-free.

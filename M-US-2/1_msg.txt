hi, i am Siva. i am really proud of work in M Turk .this online job was very useful in me and my family so really eagerly and interesting to work in the m Turk site. I get enough salary so i am really happy.Then many more works are available in the m Turk site and works are easy and working to interesting,then no problems in the site you can work on it generously. M Turk Workers asked us to make more information about the task and Requester visible while previewing or working on Hits. Workers always had access to this information by clicking â€œHIT Details, but many wanted immediate, at-a-glance visibility into the most important details. This week, we launched an improvement to display the HIT Title, Requester Name, HIT count, Reward Amount, and Time Left just above the HIT workspace. Now Workers can access these important details without having to click to access a pop-up dialog box. This change helps Worker customers quickly and easily find out what HIT they are working on, who they are working for, and potentially how many more Hits they can work on. We love hearing from the community of MTurk Workers, and encourage you to share your thoughts and ideas to improve the MTurk Worker site with us.

Working online makes it easier to meet family obligations. Time spent at home is time spent with the family. You can talk to family members while doing work. There is no time spent away from the family. Working from home is also a much more efficient use of time. Much time is wasted commuting to work and back. There is also time wasted while waiting around at work or while taking a break. It takes time to go out and get food. It takes time to get prepared to go to work. It takes time to unwind after work. An eight-hour workday really takes up more time. It takes up nearly a whole day. And after wasting so much time, people need personal time either for rest or to take care of personal things. All of these problems disappear when working from home. A home worker can get food quickly, perhaps even strengthening family bonds in the process. A home worker can take a quick break at any time and then get right back into work. There is opportunity to multitask during the day. In the end, there is much more time to enjoy the presence of family members when the work is done.

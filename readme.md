# Code and data for our adaptive matching experiment on MTurk

## Subfolders

- *R*: R and Stan code for implementing adaptive matching and data pipeline.
- *Pipeline/Qualtrics_output*: Data exported from the Qualtrics platform.
- *Pipeline/Match_files*: Data generated by R, containing processed and merged data, as well as the matchings for each wave in dated files.
- *Pipeline/Qualtrics_input*: Subfolders by participant type and sender (type 1) / receiver (type 2). These are the data read in by Qualtrics.

## Code files
- *additive_effects_logit.stan*: Implements our Bayesian additive random effect logit model for type interactions in Stan.
- *matching_functions.R*: Implements sampling from the posterior, optimal matching using linear programming, and Thompson sampling of matchings in R.
- *pipeline_input_output.R*: Reads in Qualtrics output, runs Thompson sampling for the next wave matching, stores messages and recipient/sender types in the subfolders of **Pipeline/Qualtrics_input**, and updates this Github archive.

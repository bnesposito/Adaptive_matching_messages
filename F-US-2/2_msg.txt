Family obligations are important, as are work obligations online. I've found that a good way to manage the two is to set a schedule. For example, I tend to wake up early to do my online work. This allows me to get a head start on the tasks that I need to do online. During lunch time, I can eat lunch and devote some additional time to family. It's a win-win here because if you can make food for yourself, you can also share some with your family. During this schedule you set, you can have "do not disturb" times so they understand. Also, most family members are completely understanding that people have work to do and it is a priority. In a society where more and more things are done online, it's easy to explain to them that online work is just as essential as normal work. Also, I tend to have free time during the evenings if I start early in the morning. Even though I may be fatigued, it's good knowing that I finished my work obligations online. It's a good feeling to know the additional time I have to dedicated to family is because of the schedule I set.

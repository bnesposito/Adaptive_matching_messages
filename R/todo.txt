Questions:
- When qualtrics pushes, do we get everything, or just the new stuff?
A: only the new stuff (probably)


scores go from 1 to 5!


step 2: we only get the most recent ones
merge all the files


recipient type is not stored? (unclear)

ID is the running variable, based on which we read in text files
use this to recover the recipient / sender type?
Wait?


MTurk posting of hits? Each wave have to do twice!
Manually.
2 day waves?
every day post 4 hits
every day run R code once the data are in.




Daniel Q: always delete the first 2 rows?


(multiple waves a day?)
